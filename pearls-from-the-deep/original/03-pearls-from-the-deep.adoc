=== Early Days

Forasmuch as it hath pleased Divine Wisdom to lead and conduct my soul through many,
various, and afflictive dispensations;
as well as through some very comfortable enjoyments;
giving me to partake largely of afflictions; bearing up my mind through them:
bringing me forth again and again rejoicing, after scenes of deep distress;
and wonderfully preserving me through some very deep,
and perhaps somewhat unusual probations, in my travel towards the land of rest: I feel,
and have often felt,
an engagement of mind to leave behind me some memorandums in commemoration
of his gracious dealings with me from my youth.

I was born, according to the best account I could obtain,
and according to the present or new style, on the 18th day of the 10th month, 1751,
in the township of Providence, now North Providence,
in the Colony (now State) of Rhode Island and Providence plantations, in New England.
My parents`' names were John and Lydia Scott; who were accounted honest people,
though my father made but little profession of religion.
My mother was more zealous, and attended Friends`' meetings when she conveniently could,
taking me divers times with her, and I think a few times another or two of the children;
though we were all, but young, for I, being the eldest,
was but ten years old when she died.
I can well remember the serious impressions and contemplations which,
at that early period of life, and for some years before my mother`'s decease,
attended my mind as I sat in meeting with her, and on the way home.
I even had longing desires to become truly religious, and to serve and fear God,
as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did, and others that I read or heard of.

My mother endeavoured much to restrain us from being
in the company of rude and vicious children,
and would sometimes call us together, and labour to have us sit in silence with her,
which we did: and though I then understood but little of the intent of it,
it has since afforded me a degree of solid satisfaction,
in believing the Lord had given her to know and partake
of the sublime enjoyments and substantial benefits of true,
inward, Christian silence, and waiting upon God;
and that she was desirous we her children might, in our tender years,
be made acquainted with at least some secret touches of that divine favour
which I doubt not she felt and experienced in such seasons of retirement.
And though as I observed, I understood but little about it then, yet I,
have since had reason to believe it was a real advantage to me,
and that it has often been remembered since to my benefit.

[.blurb]
=== Early Experience of Silent Waiting

I am fully persuaded of the great advantage, and spiritual usefulness,
to children and others, resulting from frequent silent waiting on the Lord.
I have seen lively and convincing evidence of it, even in children very young in years;
and fully believe the impressions of divine goodness
have been such to their minds at some such seasons,
even when there has not been a word uttered vocally, as have lastingly remained,
and powerfully tended to beget the true fear and
love of God in their young and tender hearts.
And Oh! that parents were more generally concerned to do all they could
towards leading their tender offspring into an early acquaintance with,
and relish of divine things, best learned, and most livingly,
and experimentally sealed upon the soul, in a state of silent introversion,
and feeling after God.

I was told by some of my kindred who were present at my mother`'s death,
(for it being night I was not present myself,) that her departure was joyful and glorious;
and that very near her last breath was spent in fervent supplication to the Lord her God.

[.blurb]
=== The Workings of Truth

Before I was ten years old, the workings of Truth grew so powerful in my mind at times,
that I took up several resolutions, (or at several times resolved), to amend my ways,
and live a serious and religious life,
though I was not one of the most vicious of my years;
yet enough so to be made very sensible of the Lord`'s controversy with me,
on account of the evil of my ways.
My mind became exceedingly disquieted, when I went contrary to Divine manifestation:
though I had not yet a clear sense that it was the very power and
Spirit of God upon me that so condemned and distressed me for sin,
and strove to redeem my soul from the bondage of corruption.
I now began to take notice of what I heard read and conversed of respecting religion;
and among other things,
I heard frequent mention in books and conversation of the Spirit of God;
and that good people in former times had it in them, and by it learned the will of God,
and were enabled to perform it.
I perceived it was often spoken of in both the Old and New Testament,
and many other writings.
I understood that true converts in these days also have it.
But, like many others, I overlooked its lively checks and calls in myself;
had no idea that I had ever known any thing of it; longed to be favoured with it:
but supposed it was some extraordinary appearance,
different far from any thing I ever yet had been acquainted with.

Thus the Jews, even while they were expecting Christ coming, knew him not when He came.
They overlooked and despised his mean and ordinary appearance;
thought He was Joseph`'s son and born among them, and so rejected, abused,
and finally put Him to death.
But they were mistaken in His pedigree: His descent was from heaven; and God, not Joseph,
was His Father.
Just so are thousands now mistaken,
as to the dignity and origin of God`'s Spirit in them; they think it is of _man_,
a part of his nature and being; whereas it is of the very life, power,
and substance of God.
Its descent is as truly from heaven, as was that of the Lord Jesus.
He came in that _low, mean, and ordinary_ appearance, to outward show and accommodations;
teaching us thereby "`not to despise the day of small things,`" nor overlook
the littleness of the motions of divine life in our own souls.
And when he compares the kingdom of heaven, which he expressly says is _within_,
to outward things, He very instructively inculcates to us,
that the beginnings of it are _small_,
"`a little leaven`"--"`a little seed`"--"`a grain
of mustard seed`"--"`the least of all seeds.`"
This is true in the inward, whatever it be in the outward;
for the Seed of the Kingdom is "`the least of all
the seeds`" in the field or garden of the heart.
Other seeds sprout, spring up, and take the attention, while the incorruptible seed,
"`the Word of God`" in the heart, is overlooked, trampled under and despised.

=== Learns to Dance and Play Cards

I entreat you, as you love your own souls, and prize an everlasting salvation;
I warn you, by the dreadful fruits of disobedience, by the pangs, remorse,
and sufferings of my own soul for sin and transgression!
Had I steadily obeyed the truth in my inward parts;
had I attended singly and faithfully to this divine Monitor, my portion had been peace,
my cup, a cup of consolation.
I might have rejoiced and sung, whereas I have had to mourn and weep.
For as I grew up to fifteen years and upwards, in violation of clear inward convictions,
in opposition to the dictates of the Holy Spirit, I began to run into company,
learned to dance and play cards, and took great delight therein.
I was often deeply condemned, and often strove to stifle the witness,
and persuade myself there was no harm in any of these things.

My father sometimes reproved me in those days for my conduct:
but sinning against divine light and visitations, hardened me against his advice.
I grew more and more vain, proud, airy, and wanton.
I put myself in the way of much evil communication:
and it mournfully corrupted good manners.
My taste for pleasure and amusement grew keen,
my spirits were low and languid when alone,
and I rushed into company and merriment for alleviation.

Thus I went on frolicking and gaming, and spending my precious time in vanity.
Often at night, or in the night, and sometimes near break of day,
I have returned home from my merry meetings grievously condemned, distressed,
and ashamed: wishing I had not gone into such company, and resolving to do so no more:
but soon my resolutions failed me, and I went again and again;
and thus continued making still greater strides in folly than before.
The Lord followed me close, in mercy, and often brake in powerfully upon me,
turning all my mirth into mourning; yet I still got over the holy Witness,
did despite to the Spirit of grace,
and repaired again to my haunts of diversion and merriment.
Sometimes when I have stood upon the floor to dance, with a partner by the hand,
before all were quite ready, God has arisen in judgment,
and smitten me to the very heart.

Oh!
I still feelingly remember the majesty of His appearance within me,
when none knew the agony of my soul; how He erected His tribunal in my bosom,
as in an instant, and in awfulness arraigned me before him.
I felt ready to sink under the weight of condemnation and anguish;
but resolutely mustering all the stoutness I was master of, I brazened it out,
until the music called me to the dance, and then I soon drowned the voice of conviction,
became merry, and caroused among my companions in dissipation,
until time urged a dismission of our jovial assembly, and called me to return,
often lonely, to my father`'s house, my outward habitation.
Ah me! how fared it with me then?
I assure thee, reader, I have not forgotten those sad and mournful walks,
at the conclusion of my midnight revellings.
I have been broken down in deep abasement and self-abhorrence, have come to a full stand,
stopped and sat down on a stump, stone, or log, by the way, wrung my hands,
and strewed my tears before the Lord, in sorrow and extremity of anguish,
bordering almost on desperation.
I have begged forgiveness, implored assistance and urged vowed amendment,
obtained some relief, and returned home in hope of reformation.
But alas, alas! my resolutions were written, as it were, in sand:
the power of habit had enslaved me, and almost the next invitation of my associates,
overcame all my engagements.
The eagerness of desires for diversion and pastime,
brake through all the sanctity of vows,
and violated the solemnity of sacred promises to my God.
I rushed again into transgression, as a horse rushes into the battle;
again and again I took my swing, and drank my fill:
and again and again remorse and compunction seized upon me.
Adored forever be the name of the Lord, he forsook me not,
but followed me still closer and closer,
and sounded the alarm louder and louder in mine ears.
There was in me an immortal part, which His love was towards; the recovery of which,
from the thraldom of sin and corruption,
his goodness engaged Him to seek by mercy and by judgment, frowns and smiles,
in love, chastisements and endearments, and all in love inexpressible.

[.blurb]
=== The Still Small Voice Reproves

Thus He dealt with me.
When I turned at His reproofs, He smiled graciously upon me,
and relieved my soul`'s anxiety, but when I again revolted,
His rod was lifted up in fatherly correction.
The still small voice was uttered in my dwelling, as in the cool of the day,
when a little retired from noise and commotion, "`Adam, where art thou?`"
There was no hiding from Him, whose penetrating eye no secret can escape,
and whose aim in reproving was only to save.
He still reproved my wanderings, and pointed out the right way,
according the Scripture declaration, "`Thou shalt hear a voice behind thee, saying,
This is the way, walk in it.`"
Indeed the way was shown me: it was often plainly cast up before me:
but I would not walk in it.
I knew my Lord`'s will, but did it not; mine own, I still delighted in the indulgence of.
Oh! that others may escape my load of guilt, and may I say, my bed of hell,
or inward tormenting agony, by a timely submission to the reproofs of instruction.

Sometimes I spent near all the first-day of the week when I should have been at meeting,
in playing cards, idle, if not dissolute conversation, and other vain amusements,
returning home at night in condemnation, and sometimes sighing and crying;
and yet through all this the Lord preserved me from hard drinking,
though often in the way of temptation and solicitation to it.
Swearing I also mostly refrained from.
Jesting, joking, and vain conversation, I went considerable lengths in,
and sometimes joined the foremost in filthy and obscene discourses.
Then again great shame and self-abhorrence would overwhelm me; again I vowed, promised,
and renewed my covenant: but all in vain; I had not got deep enough;
nor were my covenants made or renewed in the right ability,
but too much in my own strength and creaturely resolutions, so they soon were broken.
Sometimes I held out a week or two, other times only a day or two.
Thus time passed on, and, with an increase of years,
I found an increasing propensity to wantonness and dissipation.
But, blessed be the God of my salvation,
He proportionately increased my sense of guilt and condemnation.

[.blurb]
=== Attends Baptist Meetings

I had seasons of very serious consideration upon religion.
What instructions I had outwardly received, were mostly in the way of Friends;
but when I came near to man`'s estate,
falling in company with some of the Baptist society,
I was drawn to attend their meetings in Providence.
Friends`' meetings were oftener held in silence than suited my itching ear.
I loved to hear words, began to grow inquisitive,
and to search pretty deeply into doctrines and tenets of religion;
and the Baptist preachers filled my ears with words,
and my head with arguments and distinctions;
but my heart was little or not at all improved by them.
I almost forsook the meetings of Friends, except Yearly meetings,
and meetings appointed by travellers in the service of the Gospel.
But when I went to these,
Oh! how livingly I still remember the heavenly and heart-tendering
impressions I sometimes received under the lively,
animating testimonies delivered in the evidence and demonstration of the Holy Spirit,
and in the very life of the Gospel.
Here my _heart_ was helped, though my _head_ was less amused than among the Baptists:
however, as I knew not clearly what caused the difference,
as Friends`' meetings remained still often silent,
and as I still wished the gratification of argumentative, systematic discourses,
I still pretty diligently attended the Baptist meeting; and,
in my most religious seasons, I began to think of being baptized in water.
For the head-work so far outran the heart-work,
during my attendance of these wordy meetings, that I became convinced in speculation,
that that outward performance was an ordinance of Christ; though I have since seen,
as clear as day-light, that it never was ordained by Jesus; but was a fore-running,
preparatory, and decreasing institution, and has long since done its office,
and ceased in the church in point of obligation;
and that there is now to the true Church but one Lord, one faith, and one baptism,
that of the Holy Ghost and fire, which only can purify and make clean the inside.
Oh! my heart, my very soul is fully satisfied in this matter;
having felt the living efficacy of this one saving baptism and known its full sufficiency,
without any other.

[.blurb]
=== Predestination

I had not yet fully given up to the motions of divine life in my own heart.
My mind was too much turned outward; and the preaching of those I sometimes went to hear,
who preached in their own time, had a powerful tendency to keep it outward.
In this state of outward attention and enquiry,
I found nothing that could give me power over sin and corruption:
but notwithstanding all my serious thoughtfulness,
and frequent and ardent desires to become truly religious, I still, once in a while,
broke loose, and launched forth into as great degrees of vanity and wickedness as ever:
and then again a turn of seriousness would come over me.
One time under deep exercise,
after reasoning and hesitating great part of a day,
whether I had best give up with full purpose of heart, to lead a religious life or not;
at length I gave up, and entered once more into solemn covenant, to serve God,
and deny myself, according to the best of my understanding.

Almost as soon as I had thus given up, and come to this good conclusion,
in stepped the grand adversary,
and blundered and distressed my mind exceedingly with the doctrine of predestination;
powerfully insinuating that a certain number were infallibly ordained to eternal salvation,
the rest to inevitable destruction:
and that not all the religious exercises of my mind could possibly
make any alteration in my final destination and allotment.
If God had damned me from all eternity, I must be damned forever:
if He had chosen me to eternal salvation, I might set my heart at rest,
and live just such a life as would most gratify my natural inclinations:
for what advantage could there be in religion, and self-denial, if an eternal,
unalterable decree secured my salvation.
I felt willing to hope I was a chosen vessel; and for a short time these absurd,
and may I not say, blasphemous ideas so crowded into my mind,
that I was even ready to conclude a God all goodness,
had doomed the far greater part of mankind to never-ending misery,
without any provocation on their part.
I now view the doctrine of unconditional election to eternal life,
and reprobation to eternal destruction, with abhorrence.
I almost marvel, that even under a cloud of darkness,
my rational faculties could ever be so imposed upon,
as to assent to so monstrous a sentiment.
I know of no doctrine in the world,
that more shockingly reflects on the character of the Deity.

I did not, indeed, so drink down this stupefying potion of false doctrine,
as to relinquish my purpose of amendment all at once: I held out a few weeks, when,
mournful to relate, the influence of young company,
and my vehement desires for creaturely indulgence,
through the tolerating influence of the aforesaid insinuations,
brake through all my most solemn engagements, threw down the walls and fortifications,
and exposed me an easy prey to the grand enemy of my soul`'s salvation.
Again I took my swing in vanity, amusements, and dissipation.
This, however, was but a short race, though a wretched one.
The Lord, in unspeakable lovingkindness, followed me with His judgments,
inwardly revealed against sin.
The Prince of darkness also followed me, with temptation upon temptation to evil,
and with various subtle insinuations, and dark notions, to rid me of all fear, restraint,
or tenderness of conscience.

At length, notwithstanding all I had felt of the power of God upon me,
in reproof for sin, and invitation to holiness, yea,
though I had had some true relish of divine good, the holy Witness became so stifled,
that I began to conclude there was _no God:_ that all things came by chance, by nature,
by the fortuitous jumble and concourse of atoms, without any designing cause,
or intelligent arrangement: that it was idle, chimerical, and delusive,
to think of serving or fearing a being who had no existence but in imagination.
Here let it be well considered,
what a powerful influence the admission of one false doctrine,
and the violation of divine manifestation and conviction,
have in paving the way for other false doctrines.

[.blurb]
=== Atheism

Not much sooner had I received and cherished one
of the grand falsehoods of the father of lies,
the doctrine of irresistible necessity and predestination,
than in the mists of darkness which spread over my mind,
under the baleful influence thereof, I even dared to deny the eternal Deity, and,
horrible to the last degree to think of, I began to rejoice in the idea of unbounded,
unrestrained licentiousness and carnality,
and that I was unaccountable for my conduct not considering that,
on my atheistical scheme, I was unprotected, and had no more to hope than to fear,
none to look up to for defence and succour, but must be left a prey to violence,
and all kinds of adversity.

Oh! the depravity of taste and inclination, as well as of understanding,
which I was plunged into!
I as much marvel that I could wish there was no God,
as that I could believe so intolerable an absurdity.
One evening in company with some of my merry companions,
divers subjects were conversed on, till at length, I introduced my _new_ subject,
to see what the company could advance against it.
And being unwilling they should know that I seriously entertained the idea I advanced,
I introduced it as a supposition, declaring, that for argument`'s sake,
I could prove by reason, that there was no God,
clearer than they could prove there was one.
I talked, indeed, as upon mere supposition; but I was truly,
that "`fool that said in his heart, there is no God.`"
Yes, in my very heart, I was saying, wishing, and in measure, believing,
that there was no rewarder of the righteous, nor punisher of the wicked;
none to bring me to a reckoning hereafter, for any of my conduct.
Doleful delusion! sad sentiment to lay hold on for consolation!
I think nothing would now more certainly overwhelm my mind with melancholy,
and the most dismal despair.

Some of the company thought strange of my extravagance and presumption;
some laughed at my nonsense; and some seemed pleased with the novelty.
At length we dropped it.
Fear and condemnation soon seized upon me, even before I left my merry companions.
I tried all I could to laugh, and mount above my fears;
but my heart trembled with amazement within me, to think what a pitch I had arrived to,
and what would become of me.
I took my leave of them, and went home in agony.
I now think I should be cruel in the extreme, were I to wish my greatest enemy to endure,
unnecessarily, such fear, horror, anxiety, and amazement, as I passed through that night,
both going home, and after I arrived there.
I scarcely dared to go into my bed-chamber, lest I should be suddenly,
and in some awful manner, brought to judgment, and punished for my audacity and folly.

[.blurb]
=== The Terrors of the Lord

I went on a few months after this much in the same manner.
My days I spent in vanity and rebellion; my nights frequently in horror and distress!
Many a night I scarce durst enter my chamber, or lay me down in bed.
I have the most unshaken ground to believe, it was the immediate power of God upon me,
that thus terrified my guilty soul; and that in the most fatherly goodness,
condescension, and mercy, in order to prevent my going on to endless perdition,
to which I seemed to be swiftly posting.
But as I did not yet yield, for all this dreadful condemnation,
I was still further tried and amazed.
I was so destitute of divine countenance and support,
so left to my own emptiness and folly, and so pressed upon by the power of Omnipotence,
in just and righteous judgment and indignation,
that I began to be exceedingly terrified with strange
apprehensions and fears of ghosts and spectres.
And why might not the hand of the Lord be even in this also?
Why, after trying me, both with mercy and judgment,
and I still remaining obstinately unreclaimed, might He not in wisdom,
and distinguished justice, give me up to be perplexed and tormented,
by my own imaginations?
Especially since I had daringly denied Him any other existence than imaginary?
The wise sceptical reasoner may laugh at me, as being now, as much as ever,
under the dominion of imagination; but I confess my rejoicing,
that I am not too wise to believe, that the hand of God was pointedly operative,
and strikingly manifested in making _that_ the very seat of my torment,
which I had vilely assigned as His only seat of existence.

Day after day,
and night after night I was distressed!--the Lord setting my sins in order
before me and pleading with me to return unto Him and live.
At last I fled again to religious engagement for relief, betook myself to prayer,
and cried to the Lord, in the bitterness and agony of my spirit.
Sometimes I begged and interceded for mercy, and power to make a stand and overcome sin,
with such vehemency as if my very heart would break!
Tears gushed from my eyes!
My soul was overwhelmed with anguish!
O young man, whoever thou art, that readest these lines, I warn thee, I beseech thee,
shun such misery, by obedience; such unutterable anxiety by cleaving to the Lord.
I prayed, I cried, I repented, I sinned.
For after all this, Pharaoh yet again hardened his heart,
nor would he consent to let Israel go.
Young company, music, gaming, pleasure, again rallied their forces,
and had such influence over my resolutions, as evidenced them written as in dust,
though mingled with tears, with wormwood and gall, and I abandoned all again,
to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.

But God, rich in mercy, and long-suffering kindness, still interrupted my career,
disturbed my carnal satisfaction, and blasted all my joys.
Once more a sense of just and holy indignation kindled
up in my breast for transgression and grievous revolt.
Awfulness took hold on me; amazement swallowed me up.
I knew not which way to turn.
The wrath of an offended long-suffering God seemed closing upon me on every side.
I had tried repeatedly to reform.
I had as repeatedly failed.
I had therefore no courage to try again.
I had no resolution to re-attempt a halt: and in pursing my course,
I knew I was pursuing my daily and almost insupportable distress.
I felt myself in thraldom, and almost without hope.
I knew myself a prisoner, and yet I hugged my chains.

[.blurb]
=== A Dream

About four or five times, in a few months, I had the following dream,
repeated nearly in the same manner.
I beheld in my dream the sun nearly approaching the horizon, being just ready to set,
sometimes in one part of the hemisphere, and sometimes in another.
As it drew near setting,
my soul was suddenly filled with such awfulness and anxiety as was scarcely supportable.
A strong persuasion seized upon me, that now the world was to be instantly dissolved,
and that I, altogether unprepared,
should immediately launch into vast and endless eternity.
Directly, upon this dreadful apprehension, the sun every time reached the earth:
and as it apparently struck the earth, the fire kindled as in an instant,
at the place where it struck, and passing over the earth`'s surface,
almost as quick as lightning, would in a moment be surrounding close upon me;
approaching with the utmost rapidity, as if no flesh was to escape immediate destruction,
nor a single soul have time to think before death.
In this terrible dilemma, I thought, I every time fell awfully on my knees,
and in the deepest anguish called on the name of the Lord,
whom I had grievously offended, and begged aloud for mercy.
Almost as soon as I was brought on my knees, in deep and true humiliation,
the fire immediately all went out, and tranquillity and peace were instantly restored.
At this I awoke, I believe each time, almost overcome with joy,
that I had escaped such imminent danger.

But all proved insufficient to induce a reengagement for reformation.
It takes more and more to bend the will,
as it has been hardened against more and more lively impressions.
I went on a while longer, and wherever I went, conviction went with me.
My accuser, and yet my best friend, lay close in my bosom, and, whilst I rebelled,
as a gnawing worm, tormented me both night and day; yet all in tender love,
in order to redeem my precious soul,
and bow my stubborn will to the obedience of the cross.

[.blurb]
=== Conviction and Conversion

Thus I continued still in vanity and folly, with intervals of deep distress and mourning,
a short space longer, that is, till the winter of the year 1770, when,
being about nineteen years old, I became more fully and clearly convinced,
and that very much by the immediate operations, illuminations,
and openings of divine light in my own mind, that this inward something,
which had been thus long and powerfully striving with me, disturbing my every false rest,
confuting every false and sin-flattering imagination of flesh and blood,
or of the grand Adversary, and enjoining it upon me to give up all,
and walk in the ways of virtue and true self-denial,
was the true and living Spirit and power of the eternal God,
the very same that strove with the old world, influenced the patriarchs, prophets,
and apostles, and visits, strives with,
and at seasons more or less influences the hearts of all mankind.
I now saw this the only principle of all true conversion and salvation;
that so long as this was resisted and rejected,
separation must infallibly remain between God and the soul, but that,
whenever this is received, and in all things thoroughly submitted to,
a thorough reconciliation takes place.

Some may think this doctrine robs Christ of the honour of our redemption and reconciliation,
but I apprehend none can think so who understand the doctrine of salvation by Jesus.
It was through the eternal Spirit, this very Spirit that visits and strives with all,
that Christ offered up that prepared body.
It is through, and only through, the influence of the same Holy Spirit,
that any soul was ever converted to God,
or savingly benefited by the redemption that is in Jesus.
Whatever way, O soul, or by whatever means thou art benefited in a spiritual sense,
it is by this Holy Spirit,
that is the immediate operative power and principle within thee.

[.blurb]
=== Everything Not Felt, Unavailing

The death of Christ is nothing at all to thee, savingly,
further than thou hast the living, saving efficacy of it sealed to thee.
Nothing can possibly do this, without touching and changing thy heart.
If thou dost not _feel_ it, it is nothing.
Thou may imagine and dream a thousand things about faith, regeneration, and imputation:
but unless the Holy Spirit change thee, and give thee to feel and know salvation,
in and for thy own soul: thou would be just as much benefited,
by imagining that Joseph of Arimathea, or any other person, had purchased thy salvation,
and that, by imputation of what he had done, God would, at some future time, save thee.
For everything that is not _felt,_ is as totally unavailing to thee,
as the most ungrounded imagination; and until thou sensibly feelest some _real_ benefit,
thou hast received no more, substantially and savingly,
than thou mightest receive by a strong imagination, persuasion, and hope,
from any other quarter.

While the doctrine of salvation by Christ, is _only ideal_ with thee,
it is nothing as yet experimentally in thy possession.
And ideal it is, must, and ever will be, till thou _feelest_ it.
And feel it savingly, thou never canst, but in and by the Holy Spirit,
the very life of the whole mystery.

[.blurb]
=== What Certifies the Scriptures?

Having thus at length become livingly convinced that it was nothing short
of the eternal power and Spirit of God that so forcibly wrought in me,
in order for my deliverance from the power of darkness and seduction,
I was enabled to give up to the holy requirings of God,
as thereby inwardly made known to me--and clearly known were many things thus made.
Nothing else could ever so have opened my mind, and made known my duty to me.
The Scriptures, other good books, gospel ministry, religious conversation,
contemplation upon the works of creation and providence--all
these are very good means of information;
but none of them, nor even all of them,
without the Holy Spirit`'s sealing operation and evidence upon the mind,
can ever make a man _sure_ of his duty to God in any one thing.
He may reason, and set up many rules, measures, and standards of duty and morality;
which certainly he never will arrive at,
without the help of that which in itself is certain.
It may be said the Scriptures are certain.
Very well, but what certifies thee that they are certain,
or that thou knowest their meaning?
Do not the professed masters in reasoning widely
differ upon many passages in the sacred writings?
and do not they all say they have reason on their side?
But believe them not: nor believe that any thing is or can be certainly known to man,
as a law binding upon him, without the light and evidence of the Holy Spirit.

[.blurb]
=== Forsaking Evil

I gave up very fully and from the heart, to serve the Lord in the way of His leadings;
I forsook rude and vicious company, withdrew into retirement,
attended the meetings of Friends, and often sought the Lord,
and waited upon Him in solemn, reverential silence alone, for His counsel, direction,
and preservation; and He was graciously pleased to point out and cast up the way for me,
one thing after another, with sufficiency of clearness.
First, he showed me _negatively,_ what I ought not to do in various particulars,
breaking me off from my vicious practices and associations.
This was _forsaking evil._
And then He taught and enjoined me the practice of several things _positively_
wherein He engaged me to choose and cleave unto that which is good.
I saw clearly it was His will,
and my indispensable duty reverently to assemble with His people for divine worship,
and therein to wait upon Him, draw inwardly near unto Him, and,
according to the Apostle`'s language, "`feel after Him,`" in order to find and enjoy Him.

I also found it my duty often to wait upon Him alone, in awful, silent retirement;
not approaching Him in supplication, but when He influenced my heart thereto,
with the true spirit of prayer and intercession.
He also showed me, that religion was an internal life in the soul; that great attention,
sincerity, and punctuality were necessary to the growth and prosperity of it:
that I must not be content with attending meetings, and sitting in silence,
though ever so reverently and properly;
I must live continually in an inward watchfulness and dedication of heart;
watch all my thoughts, words, and actions, and know all brought to judgment;
and allow nothing to pass unexamined, nor willingly unapproved;
that I must observe the most upright honesty and sincerity in my dealings among men,
as in the presence of God, the witness of all my outward actions and inward volitions.
He taught me that men generally rely too much on external performances and appearances.
And thus guarding my mind against thinking too much of any thing outward,
He opened my understanding to behold my duty, in regard to outward plainness;
that a plain, decent, and not costly dress and way of living, in all things,
was most agreeable to true christian gravity and self-denial: that a rich, showy,
or gay dress, house, food, or furniture, fed and fostered pride and ostentation,
robbed the poor, pleased the vain, and led into a great deal of unnecessary care, toil,
and solicitude, to obtain the means of this way of life and appearance;
that it could not afford any true and solid satisfaction,
but must unavoidably divert the mind from inward, feeling watchfulness,
retard the work of mortification and true self-denial,
and facilitate unprofitable association and acquaintance
with such as would rather alienate the affections from God,
than unite the soul to Him.

[.blurb]
=== Plain Dress and Language--the Weak Things

Thus instructed, I bowed in reverence;
and as it became from time to time necessary to procure new clothing,
I endeavoured to conform my outward appearance in this respect to the dictates of Truth,
in which I found true peace and satisfaction.
Also He instructed me to use the plain Scripture language, THOU to one,
and YOU to more than one.
The cross greatly offended me in regard to these things.

This of language in particular,
looked so trifling and foolish to the worldly-wise part in me,
and the fear of the world`'s "`dread laugh,`" so powerfully opposed it,
that I gave way to carnal reasonings.
What good can this exactness of language do?
May I not as well serve God in a less singular and less contemptible way,
as to get into those things that will be sure to render me ridiculous?
The world can see nothing in this but whim and superstition;
and of what possible use can a man be to others,
if his singularity shuts him out from their favourable notice and attention.
And if it is of none to others, where is the harm to me, as an individual,
to continue in my customary language?
Such reasonings as these, and many more, presented in opposition to the holy injunction.
But the Lord showed me,
that if I "`would be wise,`" I must "`first become a fool;`" if I would be His disciple,
I must first deny myself, take up my cross daily,
and follow Him in the way of His leadings.
It was very hard and trying to my natural will to give up to this duty.
I thought if my right hand would excuse my compliance, I would gladly sacrifice it,
or yield it up, rather than give up to use such a despised language,
and submit to be laughed at, as viewing religion concerned in such things as these.
This may seem incredible to some, but it is true,
and as fresh with me as almost any past exercise.

This exercise beset me day and night for some time,
during which I had many sorrowful and bitter tears, pleaded many excuses,
and greatly wished some substitute might be accepted instead of the thing called for.
But He who called me into the performance of these foolish things,
(to the world`'s wisdom), was graciously pleased to show me with indubitable clearness,
that He would choose His sacrifice Himself;
and that neither a right hand nor a right eye, neither thousands of rams,
nor thousands of rivers of oil, would by any means answer instead of His requirings.
If He called for so weak or foolish a thing as the words _thou_ and _thee_ to a single person,
instead of _you,_ nothing else of my substituting would do instead of it;
for "`the foolishness of God is wiser than men.`"
Let none dispute the ground with Omnipotence, nor confer with flesh and blood;
lest therein, "`despising the day of small things,`" they "`fall by little and little.`"
For be assured, O thou called of the Lord, thou canst never become His chosen,
unless thou obey His call, and come out of all He calls thee from.
If thou art not "`faithful in the little,`" thou wilt not be made "`ruler over much.`"

[.blurb]
=== Faithful Waiting

Perhaps few will believe the fulness of heavenly joy which sprang in my bosom,
as a well-spring of living waters,
after my giving up in faithfulness to this requisition.
And yet this flow of divine consolation lasted not long at this time;
for though I gave up to whatever the Lord required of me,
yet as I had so long and so stubbornly rebelled against Him, He saw meet,
in His infinite wisdom, soon to hide His face from me again,
and close me up in almost utter darkness, which rendered my days truly tedious,
and my nights wearisome to my soul.
I was fully convinced that God was to be known inwardly, in power and great glory,
by those who obey Him, and wait upon Him.
My heart was inflamed with love towards Him.
I had seen a little of this comeliness: He had become the beloved of my soul,
the chiefest among ten thousand; therefore I often retired alone,
and in profound reverential silence, sought after Him,
and pressingly solicited a nearer acquaintance with Him.

But He, knowing what was best for me, graciously hid His presence from me.
And though this was a painful suspension,
yet I could not be easy to give over seeking Him;
I still continued my ardent silent approaches, or waitings.
I waited, indeed, with all the reverence, humility,
and solicitude that my soul was capable of; but all seemed in vain.
No spark or ray of light could I behold, no glimpse of heaven`'s returning favour.
Oh! the mourning and lamentation, the distress and bitter weeping,
that almost continually overwhelmed me for several months together,
for the want of the soul-enlivening presence of my God.
Oh! said I in my heart, will He never arise for my help and deliverance?
Well, be it as it may, I will seek Him until my dying day;
my soul cannot live without Him: and it may be,
if He hide his face from me until my last moments, He may own me at that solemn period,
and receive me to a mansion of glory.
This was often, very often, the language of my heart;
and under this resolution I pressed forward in the bitterness of my soul.
I trust the wormwood and the gall, the sorrow and the sighing,
the days and nights of anguish, will scarcely ever be forgotten.
It seems to me that certain spots of earth, some particular fields and groves, will ever,
while life and sensibility remain,
continue to have a moving and affecting influence on my mind,
as often as I pass by and see them, or call them to remembrance.
I think they must remain peculiarly distinguished to me by the tears and the groans,
the sighs and solicitations, of which they have been the silent witnesses.

O my God! thou leddest me through the desert, thou weanedst me from the world,
and alluredst me into the wilderness;
there thou didst hide Thy face from me for a season,
until the longings of my soul after Thee, were intensely kindled:
then liftedst Thou up my head, and spake comfortably to me;
blessed be thy holy Name forever!

At length the Father of mercies having thus tried me,
He graciously cast an eye of compassion upon me, hearkened to the voice of my distress,
made bare His everlasting arm for my deliverance,
gradually unveiled His holy presence to me,
and opened my heart to understand why He led me through so trying a dispensation.
I now began to discern in the mystery what I read in the
history of Israel`'s forty years travel in the wilderness,
as also the voice of one crying in the wilderness.
I began to see the necessity of the Lord`'s sending his forerunner,
that the way might be prepared, and the paths made straight.
I perceived much roughness, unevenness, and crookedness had been in the way.
I began to know and in degree to love the rod, and Him who had appointed it;
and as the Master manifested Himself more and more,
I understood more and more of the mysterious ways of His working.

[.blurb]
=== All Sunshine--Not for the Best

After some time I had many clear openings respecting the many trials, experiences,
jeopardies, and deliverances, of His followers in days past;
and a hope was kindled in me,
that now I should go forward without meeting with such besetments,
and withdrawings of light, as heretofore;
for though the Lord still at times withdrew from me,
yet as His return was not long after,
and as His presence was much more constantly with me,
I was ready to conclude it would continue with increasing brightness,
till I should be wholly and continually swallowed up in His love.
For, as such a state was sometimes permitted me,
I not clearly understanding the counsel of His divine will,
was apt to wish it for my constant condition; not then seeing, as I have since seen,
that it was far from being best for me to enjoy a constancy of sunshine and fair weather.

[.blurb]
=== The Outward Creation--a Picture of the Christian Walk

Even the outward order and economy of divine Providence afford instruction,
which often beautifully applies to our inward experiences.
It is not all calm and sunshine:
the divine wisdom orders many and great vicissitudes and changes in the natural world;
insomuch that, perhaps in the most pleasant and flourishing season in the whole year,
after a few days of clear shining and tranquillity, there arises a most terrible storm,
with wind, lightning, and tremendous thunder;
and it may be with hailstones scattered abroad upon the face of the earth.
At other times, high and rushing winds succeed the calmest day,
or pinching droughts the most fruitful season.
Even the settled order and succession of seasons
is a continual revolution of day and night,
summer and winter, seed-time and harvest.
We have cold as well as heat; darkness as well as light;
and cutting frosts as well as most refreshing dews; and a variety of other changes.
All this is in infinite wisdom and goodness,
and displays to the discerning eye the providential power and glory of the great Superintendent.

My soul has sometimes been enraptured whilst I have viewed
and contemplated the operations of His hand in these things,
together with the situation of places, rocks and lofty mountains,
and sturdy oaks and tall cedars, rivers, lakes, and oceans, meadows, fields, and forests,
deserts and vast howling wildernesses,
with the various inhabitants of both land and water: and over and above all these,
the sun, moon, and stars in their courses, the spangled firmament,
and constellations of heaven!
All these things, though far short of being sufficient food for immortal souls,
and perhaps not best to dwell much upon,
have nevertheless animatingly affected my mind in the contemplation of them,
and raised my soul in adoration to him who is the Former of all things; and who,
when He was pleased to answer out of the whirlwind,
and awfully to interrogate his servant Job, for his instruction,
was pleased to make the wonderful works of His hand,
and the excellent order of His government, the subjects of His demands.

And who among the sons of men can read the solemn
queries then uttered by the Divine Majesty,
and not feel some tender emotions of soul--some sacred emanations of light, and life,
and divine power breaking in upon him! "`Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days,
and caused the day-spring to know his place?`"
is one among the many solemn and sublime interrogatories,
by the wisdom of an all-knowing God, demanded of His servant; sufficiently declaring,
beyond all hesitation, how infinitely exalted above all human comprehension,
He is in Wisdom, power, and glory;
as well as amply setting forth His goodness to the sons of men,
in causing the regular returns of day and night,
and other wonderful successions and revolutions,
for the benefit and comfort of His dependent creatures!
Bow, O my soul! adore and worship the God of thy life, who is the length of thy days,
and thy portion forever.
His works are wondrous, past finding out, marvellous, and beyond thy comprehension.
Thou seest in part the multitude and magnitude of His wonderful works;
thou beholdest a small part of the changes and vicissitudes attending them:
and yet through all, what excellent order, harmony, and regularity are preserved!
Surely nothing less than omnipotence joined with omniscience
could possibly effect or produce all this.
Thou seest He is faithful in performing His ancient gracious promise.
Day and night, seed-time and harvest, etc., shall not fail.

Whatever He absolutely determines, He is therein immutable.
He is a God of truth and He cannot lie.
His promises are all yea and amen, forever.
And though He exercise the souls of His chosen with various and afflictive dispensations,
yea, even _choose_ them in the furnace of affliction,
yet His love to them can no more fail, than day and night can cease,
or _His_ covenant with them be disannulled.
He never said unto the seed of Jacob, "`seek ye my face in vain.`"
Nay verily; the language of His compassionate regard, on the contrary,
is "`Fear not worm Jacob, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee:
when thou goest through the water,
it shall not overwhelm thee; or when through the fire, it shall not kindle upon thee.`"
It is as much in wisdom and goodness that He sometimes as it were withdraws, hides from,
and leaves His children,
and then again returns gloriously for their unspeakable consolation,
as is the succession of darkness and light, cold and warm seasons, in the outward.

[.blurb]
=== Afflictions Necessary

Many and varied afflictions are necessary to our refinement.
Hence the place of this refinement is called, "`the furnace of affliction.`"
Through the purifying operations of these fiery trials,
the soul is gradually redeemed from the pit of pollution.
It is a precious work of divine power to hide pride from man.
And he who becomes thoroughly acquainted with the corruptions of human nature,
in its alienation from God, will find,
if ever true humiliation and renovation are effected in him,
that nothing short of the baptism of fire can rightly cleanse the corrupt,
and humble the proud heart of fallen man.
Indeed it is a sealed truth, that they who are without chastisement are bastards,
and not sons.
All that the Father loveth, He chasteneth; and scourgeth every one that He receiveth.
My soul rejoiceth and giveth God thanks for deep
probations and withdrawings of His presence,
as well as for the sensible incomes of His love,
and arisings of the light of His countenance upon me.
I see and own it needful to my growth in the divine life,
as well as in order to my complete emancipation from the servitude of sin,
that He should deal thus with me; and it has afforded instruction to my mind,
that He is called in Scripture by the name of "`the
Lord that hideth His face from the house of Jacob.`"
Oh! what panting of soul, what anxious solicitude for His return,
takes place in all the true travellers, when He veils His holy presence:
and how joyful is the lifting up of His countenance after these seasons,
upon the drooping mind, thus prepared for the comfortable returns thereof!
It is like the return of clear shining after rain.

[.blurb]
=== Humility

Under the refining hand of God`'s power, whereby He thus humbled and abased my soul,
I was given clearly to see the need I should have of this excellent qualification,
_humility,_ in my further progress in religious life.
I saw pretty clearly, in the midst of my deepest depression,
that if I should be favoured with unremitted tranquillity and divine enjoyment,
I should be in danger of spiritual pride and exaltation.
Blessed be the name of the Lord, for this among His many other favours,
that He taught me the necessity of humility, and forewarned,
and therein forearmed me against the wiles of Satan,
which I afterwards became more fully acquainted with.
Oh! with what ardency of desire did my prayers ascend before Him,
that He would rebuke the proud luciferian spirit,
and appoint my dwelling in the low valley, where the grass is green,
and where the fragrant flowers give forth a pleasant smell.
I saw that on the lofty mountains often reign barrenness and desolation.
My mind was almost constantly impressed, in those days,
with the love and desire of deep humility.
I saw something of its real beauty, and craved it as one of the greatest blessings.
Oh! said I, that I may put it on as a garment, and wear it forever: yea,
even appear in it before my Judge, in the assembly of saints and angels,
in a future state.
"`O Lord, my God,`"! was then my language, and my heart now enjoins it,
"`suffer me never to forget my tribulations, nor to cease my supplications to Thee,
for the continuance of this precious blessing;
let it be the first and the last in the catalogue of my requests.`"

Thus the great Leader of Israel, led me on from step to step;
not by any means through a constant and uninterrupted enjoyment of His presence, but,
which for me has been far better, by frequent withdrawings, strippings,
and deep felt emptiness, poverty and want; and that again and again repeated,
even after large overflowings of His love in my soul,
as a river overflowing all its banks.
Had He not, after such seasons of rejoicing, veiled His presence,
and clothed my soul with mourning, I might, like ancient Israel, have "`sang His praise,
and soon forgot His works.`"
But now, through the many tribulations, and wise turnings of His holy hand upon me,
my soul remains bowed,
and to this day sensible of the tendering impressions of His love and goodness.
The savour of life is still fresh within me.
He has led me about and instructed me, and, with reverence I speak it,
hath kept and preserved me.
May I still be preserved,
and henceforth forever kept safe under His all-powerful protection;
walking worthy of the same to the end of my days.
Amen.

[.blurb]
=== Comes Forth in the Ministry

During a great part of the foregoing exercises, I had frequent openings,
and lively prospects respecting the Christian warfare,
and the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.
I often believed, in the openings of divine light, that, if I stood faithful,
it would be required of me to declare to others what the Lord had done for me,
and given me an understanding of,
and to entreat my fellow creatures to seek an habitation
in that kingdom that cannot be shaken or fade away.
This concern began now to grow upon me considerably, even to that degree,
that I felt at times in meetings a living engagement
to communicate somewhat to the people.
But, fearing I should begin in that great work before the right time, I kept back;
and even divers times, when I was almost ready to stand up,
I have concluded I would keep silence this once more; considering within myself,
that if my so doing should be displeasing to the Lord,
He would manifest His displeasure to me;
but if I should presume to speak a word in His Name,
and it should prove to be without His holy requiring, or too soon,
I should not only displease Him, but also burden His people, and perhaps get into,
and become entangled in, a way of speaking from too small motions or impressions felt,
or mournfully mistake the sparks of my own kindling for divine impressions; which might,
in consequence of my giving way thereunto, be suffered to increase upon me,
to my great loss in the substantial and divine life, if not to my utter ruin.

In this guarded frame of mind I passed on for some time,
often seeking the Lord for counsel and direction in this and other concerns of importance.
And though I believe I might have publicly borne testimony in the Name, power,
and approbation, of the Lord, rather sooner than I did, yet as I was not obstinately,
but carefully backward, I seldom felt much condemnation for withholding: however,
I did a few times find some real uneasiness on that account.
But He who laid the concern upon me, well knowing the integrity of my heart,
and that I was bent faithfully to serve Him, without going too fast,
or yet tarrying behind my guide, dealt graciously with me,
passed by my little withholdings, favoured with fresh and increasing incomes of His love,
and, from time to time, cast up my way with still greater clearness;
and at length in a manner so clear and confirming,
as erased doubt and hesitation from my mind; in the fresh authority whereof,
I uttered a few words in our meeting at Providence, on the first day of the week,
and 10th of the 4th month, 1774, to my own and I believe my friends`' satisfaction.
I felt the returns of peace in my own bosom, as a river of life,
for a considerable time afterwards, sweetly comforting my mind,
and confirming me in this solemn undertaking.
The words I uttered were as follows: "`My mind hath often, yea, very often,
been attended with earnest desires for the good of souls,
particularly for the attenders of this meeting; and in an especial manner for a remnant,
whose hearts, I believe, God has touched.
And the language of my mind has often been after this manner:--Oh!
that Zion might arise and shake herself from the dust of the earth,
and put on her beautiful garments.`"
Having, in brokenness of heart,
and in great care not to exceed the bounds of divine requisition,
uttered these few words, I sat down, and was, as it were,
swallowed up in the luminous presence of Him who inhabits eternity,
and dwells in the light.

After some time of heavenly rejoicing,
I began again to be tried with various exercises and conflicts of mind,
though still frequently favoured with the flowings of divine love,
in a very comfortable and soul-satisfying manner.
At divers times I had lively impressions to say a few words more, in public testimony;
but still waited to be well assured.

[.blurb]
=== Chewing the Cud--Dividing the Hoof

The unspeakable consolation which I found, on my first uttering a few words,
and that after a considerable time of rather holding back, than hasty procedure,
had fully confirmed me that there is greater safety in turning the fleece,
and well proving it, both wet and dry,
than in rushing forward in the first operations or openings.
The beasts allowed in sacrifice, were to chew the cud and divide the hoof.
Chewing the cud is a deliberate act: they chew and swallow, and chew and swallow again.
The division of the hoof, being on the _stepping_ member,
shows the danger of taking a single step in divine services,
without a clear division of things, and the way cast up in the mind.
As I thus waited for clearness, not being by once succeeding, encouraged to run too fast,
I was favoured to know the fire of the Lord rightly kindled upon His altar,
and to witness an offering of His own preparing.
I am well assured that such, and such only,
are the offerings which will find acceptance with Him.
He never will reject these, any more than accept those of human obtruding.

My second public appearance in the ministry was at the lower meetinghouse in Smithfield,
the 19th of the 10th month, 1774,
when I found a living concern to encourage a careful engagement before the Lord,
out of meetings, and to press it upon Friends to draw nigh unto Him from day to day;
that strength may be renewed, and the divine savour of Life retained,
lest we lose the living sense of what we graciously enjoy in our religious meetings.
Life, divine life, attended me in this little testimony, as in the former;
after meeting I enjoyed the sweet influence of Him Who is the God of my salvation,
in a degree that was greatly to my confirmation and encouragement.

After this I still continued seeking unto and waiting upon God for counsel and direction;
in which frame of mind I was favoured to renew and
increase a living acquaintance with Him,
and witnessed fresh instruction to my mind.
I appeared but seldom in public testimony, and mostly in a few words at a time,
and yet I have some few times been made sensible of saying too much,
for which I have felt more pain of mind than I have often felt, if ever, for withholding.
However, through merciful preservation, I have seldom, to my knowledge,
appeared oftener or said more than has tended to my own relief and satisfaction, and,
for aught I know, to the satisfaction of my brethren.
Blessed be the Name of the Lord my God!
I bow awfully before Him, for His directing and preserving presence,
through many deep probations.
He has been with me in the heights and in the depths; has strung my bow,
and covered my head in the day of battle.
May I serve Him faithfully all the days of my stay here until I go hence,
and be seen of men no more.

[.blurb]
=== Keep the Faith

At this time I kept a school for Friends`' children, in the town of Providence;
and having for several years past believed, at times,
that it might be best to preserve some account of
my pilgrimage through the wilderness of this world,
I now began a more regular and constant journal of my exercises,
and the Lord`'s gracious dealings with me, than I had heretofore preserved.
I had before made a few minutes of some remarkable occurrences, which,
together with what was fresh in my memory, and so recorded there as not likely soon,
if ever, to be obliterated, enabled me to write the foregoing account,
and thus to bring it forward at this time.

Indeed it is easy to hope and believe we shall trust in the Lord, when He shines upon us,
with fulness of light, and sheds abroad His love in our hearts,
making us livingly to joy and rejoice in His presence,
which was now graciously my happy experience; but,
alas! when we have again and again to pass through the valley and shadow of death,
it is not so easy to stand firm, _keep the faith,_ and trust in God.

My exercised soul has had large experience of these heights and depths,
and knows that nothing but divine power can uphold us in times of deep probation,
which we must pass through in our travels toward the land of rest.
And oh! that none may give out in such seasons, or faint in their minds;
it is no new thing; it is the beaten path,
and all the Lord`'s ransomed must become acquainted with it, and travel in it,
not taking their flight in the winter; and as they thus stand firm,
they will joyfully witness, in the Lord`'s time, the winter to be over,
the spring to arrive, the summer to advance, the time of the singing of birds to be come,
and the voice of the turtle to be heard in their land.
Oh! the pangs and sufferings through which some have waited
again and again for the return of these blessed enjoyments,
these moments of refreshment from the presence of the Lord;
but none have ever rightly waited on the Lord in vain.
Therefore trust in Him, O my soul, forever,
for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.

[.blurb]
=== God our Sanctuary

In time of silence and retirement, in family devotion,
wherein we were engaged to wait upon the Lord, for the renewal of strength together,
my mind was livingly opened into a fresh and humbling sense
of the unspeakable love and goodness of God to poor,
frail, finite man in ancient days;
particularly I was bowed in consideration of His wonderful dealings with Noah,
and how He was with him in the ark,
and how He taught him to prepare it for his own and family`'s preservation:
how He was with Abraham when he left his father`'s house at His command,
and went forth not knowing whither he was to go.
Also how He was with Israel in Egypt, through the Red Sea, the wilderness, and Jordan,
with David, when he fled from Saul, being hunted as a partridge upon the mountains,
with Jonah, in the whale`'s belly, with Daniel, in the fiery lion`'s den,
and the three children, in the fiery furnace; with His own well beloved Son,
in the great trials and temptations which He was
led through in the wilderness and among men.
Also how He was with the Apostles, and supported them when men rose up against them,
and through all their perils by sea and land, and by and among false brethren.

What shall I say?
He has ever been a sanctuary and safe hiding place for the righteous in all ages,
and remains to be so still; and as truly and powerfully so, now as ever.
And as my mind was thus led and opened, earnest breathings were begotten in me,
that we of the present generation, who have known His lovingkindness,
may walk worthy of the continuance thereof, and never distrust His care and providence;
assuredly believing, that He who hath been with us in six troubles,
will not leave us in the seventh, if we firmly trust in, and steadfastly follow Him.
But if we should draw back, His soul would then have no pleasure in us.
Oh! therefore, saith my soul, that we may be vigilant,
knowing that our adversary the devil, like a roaring lion, goes about continually,
seeking whom he may devour.

[.blurb]
=== The American War--Taxes

+++[+++1775]
On first-day, the 18th of 6th month,
a paper was sent from our deputy-governor to the Friends of our meeting,
requesting that such as had small arms would produce them at the courthouse next day,
in order that the guns in the government might be known,
and an account thereof sent to the continental congress.
After mature consideration,
a paper was signed by such male members of our society as lived within the town,
in answer to said request,
informing that our religious principles and conscientious persuasion,
did not admit of a compliance.
This was carried to the deputy-governor, who received it kindly, and seemed satisfied,
saying, he believed liberty of conscience was the natural right of all mankind.
Thus the Lord made way for us; blessed be His holy Name forever.

Much close exercise of mind I had for a considerable length of time,
on account of some particular scruples, which from time to time revived with weight,
and so pressingly accompanied me, that I could not get rid of them.
It being a time of war, and preparations for war between Great Britain and America,
and the rulers of America having made a paper currency professedly
for the special purpose of promoting or maintaining the said war;
and it being expected that Friends would be tried by requisitions for taxes,
principally for the support of war, I was greatly exercised in spirit,
both on the account of taking and passing the said money,
and in regard to the payment of such taxes, neither of which felt easy to my mind.

I believed a time would come when Christians would not so far contribute
to the encouragement and support of war and fightings,
as voluntarily to pay taxes that were mainly, or even in considerable proportion,
for defraying the expenses thereof: and it was also impressed upon my mind,
that if I took and passed money that I knew was made on purpose to uphold war,
I should not bear a testimony against war that for me, as an individual,
would be a faithful one.
I knew the people`'s minds were in a rage against such as, from any motive whatever,
said or acted any thing tending to discountenance the war.
I was sensible that refusing to pay the taxes, or to take the currency,
would immediately be construed as a pointed opposition to the present war in particular,
as even our refusing to bear arms was,
notwithstanding our long and well-known testimony against it.
I had abundant reason to expect great censure, and some suffering,
in consequence of my faithfulness, if I should stand faithful in these things,
though I knew that my scruples were unconnected with any party considerations,
and uninfluenced by any motives but such as respect the propriety
of a truly Christian conduct in regard to war at large.
I had no desire to promote the opposition to Great Britain, neither had I any desire,
on the other hand, to promote the measures or success of Great Britain.
I believed it my business not to meddle with any thing from such views,
but to let the potsherds of the earth alone in their smiting one against another.
But I wished to be clear in the sight of God,
and to do all that He might require of me towards the fuller introduction
and coming of His peaceable kingdom and government on earth.
I found many well concerned brethren,
who seemed to have little or nothing of these scruples,
and some others who were like-minded with me herein.

Under all these considerations the times looked somewhat gloomy;
and at seasons great discouragement spread over my mind.
But after some strugglings, and a length of close exercise,
attended with much inward looking to the Lord for direction and support,
I was enabled to cast my care upon Him and to risk myself and my all in his service,
come whatever might come, or suffer whatever I might suffer in consequence thereof.
I was well aware of many arguments and objections against attending to such scruples;
and some seemingly very plausible ones from several passages of Scripture,
especially respecting taxes;
but I believed I saw them all to arise from a want of clear
understanding respecting the true meaning of the said passages;
I knew I had no worldly interest, ease, or honour,
to promote by an honest attention to what I believed
were the reproofs and convictions of divine instruction.
I well knew, not only by reading, but experimentally,
that "`he that doubteth is damned (condemned) if he eat`";
and that what is contrary to faith and conviction is sin:
therefore I chose rather to suffer in this world,
than incur the displeasure of Him from whom cometh all my consolation and blessings.

=== Nearer Unity--A Prayer

This evening my heart was filled with the love of God,
under the influence whereof ardent desires were begotten in my soul,
that the little handful of Friends hereaway, might draw nearer and nearer,
and bow in holy awfulness, and reverential fear before the great Shepherd of Israel,
undoubtedly believing, that were this enough the case,
we should witness in a much greater degree, the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace;
which would cement us together in that divine harmony,
wherein we should become as an army with banners,
and as a royal diadem in the hand of our God.
And, being engaged in a holy watchfulness one over another for good,
the strong would be made willing to bear the infirmities of the weak.
Thus should we walk together to the city of our God, rejoicing in that holy fellowship,
which Christ and His disciples enjoy.
When this becomes fully witnessed,
I believe the eyes of many tender-hearted enquirers will be turned towards us,
and perhaps they may be smitten with a sense of that inward adorning
which renders the King`'s daughter all glorious within.
And who knows but that under such feeling prospects, some might be ready to cry out,
with one formerly, "`Happy art thou, O Israel! who is like unto thee,
O people favoured by the Lord, the shield of thy help,
and who is the sword of thy excellency!
There is no enchantment against Jacob nor divination against Israel.`"

And by this means, many souls might be brought to love the beauty of holiness,
and to give up in faithfulness and obedience to the divine law,
until they might obtain "`part in the first resurrection,`" and be made to sing with joy,
with the generation of the righteous, who "`walk in white.`"
Thus might the knowledge of God increase from time to time,
until the earth might enjoy her Sabbaths again.

O Lord God Almighty! thou who art from everlasting to everlasting,
whose watchful eye beholds the state of Thy creatures,
wherever scattered over the face of the earth.
O holy Father! let Thine ear be attentive to the secret breathing of thy pure seed,
which groans for deliverance from the power of corruption.
Bring many, O Eternal God! who are strangers to Thy holy covenant of rest and peace,
and aliens to the commonwealth of Israel--bring them, dearest Father,
into a nearer acquaintance with thee, the Fountain of ancient,
everlasting goodness and the Well-spring of life.
Bring them from the barren mountains of empty profession, into Thy green pastures,
and cause them to drink of the rivers of pleasures which are at Thy right hand.
And, gracious God!
I earnestly beseech Thee, with a heart contrite before Thee,
to remember with a fatherly regard, thy little babes,
whom Thou hast allured as into the wilderness, and made willing to follow Thee,
through great tribulation.
Remember them, O Lord! and take Thy lambs in Thy bosom.
Feed them with the heritage of Jacob their father,
and be with them in all their probations; and suffer not their faith to fail,
when Thou mayst see meet to hide Thyself from them for a moment; but arise again,
O Thou most mighty! and save Thy people: and beget an unfailing confidence in them.
Make them to know that Thou encampest round about them that fear Thee.
Unite them, O Lord! in an holy covenant with Thyself,
and in dear unity one with another.
Strengthen them in the inward man.
Make them--establish them, as mount Zion, which can never be removed.
And when their painful race is run, and they yield up the ghost, take them to Thyself,
O Infinite Jehovah! with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to join the general assembly,
in celebrating Thy ever worthy Name forever and forevermore.

=== Paper Money for War

On the 18th of 5th month, 1776, I made a visit to my dear friend Jonathan Farnum,
at Uxbridge, who was very far gone in a consumption.
I sat up with him during the night,
and in the morning we had some serious conversation together, in the course of which,
after mentioning that he had given up all expectation of recovery,
and felt resigned in mind, and willing to leave all, even his dear children,
he said considerable about the taxes, and something about the paper money;
that he had been much exercised upon these subjects,
and it appeared clear to him that Friends ought to have nothing to do with either.
It also appeared to him, he said, that such as took the money,
helped the people to use the sword.
"`And Oh!`" said he, "`that Friends may keep their hands clean,
and not defile them with blood.`"
I suppose his meaning was, that the money being made expressly for the support of war,
to give it currency was at least remotely helping forward and promoting war,
and in that sense assisting people to use the sword.

[.blurb]
=== Worldly Mindedness--Scruples

After this he said considerable by way of lamentation over
the low and degenerated state of many in our society,
saying, "`This have I seen to my sorrow, that a worldly spirit has crept,
and is creeping into our society, and prevailing over many; and some,
who have been somewhat shining, are become very dim,
and are rather stumbling blocks in the way of others.
I would not judge hard of my friends.
I believe there is a little remnant that are honest; but far the greater part,
appear to me to run with the tide,
and instead of being alarmed at these alarming and distressing times,
seem to have sunk deeper into the spirit of the world, and engaged to scrape together,
and think they can heap up, and build barns, and so on,
and I don`'t know that any thing will alarm them, till it is too late.`"
After a time of silence, he began again, saying, "`I am glad to see my friends.
I respect them; some who seem engaged, are very near to me; they feel near to me,
but such as seem to come out of curiosity, don`'t feel so near.`"
He then in a very lively and affecting manner,
resumed the very mournful subject of worldly-mindedness,
wishing that those who were deeply entangled in it, might come down,
and feel after their real state;
saying also that he had felt his mind engaged to sound an
alarm to almost every friend that had been to visit him.

Sometime after, he said: "`Such as have tender scruples in their minds,
ought not to be discouraged, but rather otherwise.
But how can those who are in the spirit of the world, judge of these things?
They must be redeemed, before they can be judges.
They must come out of the spirit and reasonings of the world.
For it is not reasoning upon policy that is the thing,
but waiting to feel what the Lord requires.
There is no way of safety, when we have tender scruples, but in attending to them,
and not reason, and reason ourselves into the dark.
I believe I had, when the first bill was presented to me, a sufficient check,
had it been attended to, to have prevented my touching it.
I believe so.
We must have a care of that spirit which says, we cannot live without taking it.
David said, he had never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread;
I believe God never will forsake the faithful, nor will their seed beg bread.
This spirit of the world!--Oh! that Friends may be redeemed out of it.`"

And further,
speaking of the danger and delusiveness of the temptations
by which Friends are drawn away into worldly-mindedness,
he lamented that it overcame them without their being fully sensible of it, adding,
"`It is the most secret, artful, and ensnaring temptation that ever I was tried with.`"
He seemed much concerned that he himself had not kept more fully clear of it;
but hoped his great Master, when he had suffered enough,
would pass by and forgive his faults in this respect.
"`Oh!`" said he, "`I think I could say a great deal to some Friends, if they were here.
I believe the great Jehovah will sift his Church.
I don`'t doubt it.
I don`'t doubt it.
And I hope the sincere mourners here and there, will not be discouraged.
Their spirits are near to me; but I want the others to be alarmed, and get down,
and search out the spirit of the world.`"

This discourse was attended with great sensibility, tenderness, and solemnity.
My mind was much affected,
under a sense of the pertinency of it to the real state of things among us;
and living desires arose powerfully within me, that we might indeed be rightly alarmed,
and also truly redeemed from the world.
While, with him, I mourned over the desolations of sin.
I greatly rejoiced at the lively and heavenly frame of dear Jonathan`'s mind.
Indeed, I sensibly felt him in the fellowship and covenant of divine life, and therein,
taking leave of him, I returned home,
rejoicing that I had thus been favoured with such a sweetly encouraging opportunity,
as it was truly to me, to press forward through all the crowds of opposition,
and to hold fast the testimony of truth, without wavering, steadfastly to the end.

[.blurb]
=== Pretenders

We saw here +++[+++Richmond, N. H.]
a very noisy man, in talk and preaching, (as I suppose he accounted it,) about religion.
He spoke a great deal about the motions of the Spirit,
and said he was acting in obedience to his Lord and Master Jesus Christ.
But the frothy, insensible, and unsavoury state that he appeared to act and speak in,
was enough, I thought, to prejudice almost any one,
who was not well established in the truth of the doctrine of Divine assistance,
and the influence and leadings of the Spirit in the work of the ministry,
against any such doctrine.
To all who are livingly acquainted with the openings and influence of the Holy Spirit,
the great difference is very evident,
between everything that proceeds livingly therefrom, and the confusion, nonsense,
and ranterism, which this wild pretender thereto was overrun with.
And this remark occurs:
that it is probable there would be few pretenders to divine
influence if no such thing was known at all as a reality.
All counterfeit coin implies, and is an imitation of something real and substantial.
And they who are well acquainted with the reality,
know certainly that there is such a thing, however,
others may be dealing in counterfeits.

But as we do see, both the possibility and frequency of counterfeits,
it highly behooves all who would not impose, not be imposed upon,
to see well to the currency they are taking or passing;
and not rest satisfied either to receive or circulate,
under the specious pretence of Divine impulses or the motions of the Spirit,
any kind of false, counterfeit coin; but carefully rejecting all such,
keep close to _that_ which comes out of the King`'s mint, and has His royal stamp upon it.
This will pass currency throughout all His dominions,
and none need be ashamed to receive nor to pass it.

But, to dismiss the simile, there is a wildfire now, as there was formerly;
and it can no more have place now, in true gospel worship,
than the wild (or strange) fire could be approved in the offerings under the law,
where we find it was strictly forbidden.
And whether it be generally known and understood to be so now, or not,
the prohibition is in as full force, and as binding on all true worshippers in our day,
as ever it was of old.
Oh! that Israel may ever observe strictly, this important prohibition.
I am persuaded that a due observance thereof would contribute greatly
to the brightness and prosperity of our religious society,
and to the spreading and advancement of the kingdom of the Messiah.

[.blurb]
=== Distress about Paper (War) Money

Having for nearly a year declined taking the paper currency,
agreeably to the secret persuasion which I had of my duty therein, as before mentioned,
I have now the satisfaction of comparing the different rewards of obedience and disobedience.
For though, from the very first circulation of the said money,
I felt uneasy in taking it;
yet fears and reasonings of one kind or another prevailed on me to take it for a season,
and then it became harder to refuse it than it would probably have been at first.
But growing more uneasy and distressed about it, at length I refused it altogether:
since which I have felt great peace and satisfaction of mind therein,
which has in a very confirming manner been increasing from time to time,
the longer I have refused it.
And although I get almost no money of any kind, little other being in circulation,
yet I had much rather live and depend on Divine Providence, for a daily Supply,
than to increase in the mammon of this world`'s goods,
by any ways or means inconsistent with the Holy will of my heavenly Father.
The prayer of my soul to Him is, that I, and all His children,
may be preserved faithful to Him in all His requirings,
and out of that love of things here below, which alienates from the true love of,
and Communion with Him.

[.blurb]
=== True Charity--Backbiting

My mind was impressed so deeply with a lively sense of the excellency and necessity
of true Christian charity that I had to speak of it in our meeting,
in the constrainings of the Father`'s love,
labouring to encourage Friends to cultivate this excellent virtue,
in their own minds and in each other.

If this was sufficiently prevalent among us, we should enjoy the Divine presence,
in our solemn assemblies and sittings together;
and it would prevent tale-bearing and back-biting among us,
and supply a mantle of love to cast over each other`'s weaknesses and infirmities,
so that though we might have occasion sometimes to advise,
and deal plainly with one another,
yet we should be careful of entertaining hard thoughts,
or using any hard speeches about each other.
Indeed there is too much work to do at home, when we are rightly engaged,
to allow us either much time, or much inclination,
to be speaking or thinking lightly of others.
A sense of our own weakness bows us to the root,
and a travail of soul is experienced for our own, and others`' preservation:
and in this state, it is much more eligible to us to suffer with and for each other,
than to indulge a whispering, tattling, tale-bearing disposition.

[.blurb]
=== Blunder in Testimony

+++[+++1777]
For the want of close attention to the word of Divine Life in my own soul,
I made a blunder in my public testimony which greatly humbled me,
and made me very careful and watchful afterwards.
Oh! it is good to trust in the Lord with all our hearts,
not leaning to our own understandings.
It was relying too much on my own understanding and memory,
which brought this great anxiety upon me, and I record it for future caution,
meanwhile beseeching God Almighty to preserve me, and all His true gospel ministers,
in the right line of safety and divine qualification,
which is in and with the opening of the Spirit, and with the understanding also.

[.blurb]
=== First Supplication in Public--Idolatry.

After a few words which I became concerned to express in our week-day meeting,
my mind was so clothed with the spirit of prayer and supplication,
that I was prevailed upon to kneel down and publicly address the throne of grace,
nearly in these words: "`O Lord God Almighty!
Thou who art from ever- lasting to everlasting!
Hear, O Lord, we pray thee, and arise for the help of the suffering seed.
Circumcise Thy people`'s hearts to love and fear thee.
Baptize us in the river of judgment.
Spare not Thy rod, nor withhold Thy hand, till Thou hast bowed the stubborn will,
and brought forth judgment unto victory.
And then, O gracious Father! pour in the oil of consolation,
and heal the wounds with the balm of Gilead.
Sanctify us, O Lord, for Thy service.
Cleanse us, we humbly pray Thee, in Thy fire which is in Zion,
and purify us in Thy furnace which is at Jerusalem,
that we may be a people to all the praise of Thy great Name,
which is worthy of all adoration and praise forevermore.
Amen, amen.`"
This was the first time I ever appeared in vocal, public supplication;
and it was truly much in the cross, as also in great tear and reverence.
It was indeed to me an awful thing publicly to call on the Name of the Lord,
and I have been many times sorely grieved at the light, easy,
and unfeeling manner in which many do it.

I had divers times before felt my mind so impressed with something of a like engagement,
that I scarcely forbore the utterance of it,
but was afraid of false fire and of idolatry.
Alas, for many professing Christians of our day!
How little they are aware of the prevalence of idolatry among them!
The same indeed in the ground, spring, and substance of it,
as that which is so repeatedly and severely reproved in the Scriptures.
For truly, every offering which is not of God`'s immediate preparation in us,
is idolatry, and not a whit more useful to men, or acceptable to God,
than those idolatries among the Jews.

[.blurb]
=== Waiting Patiently

_Waiting upon God,_ implies a time of patient looking for His coming,
and _waiting_ to know His will, and receive His orders.
Willing and running,
and hastily intruding upon Him with expression and utterance of our own, is _not waiting._
"`I waited patiently,`" says David, "`upon the Lord.`"
Here was patience, and holy expectation, not rushing hastily forward.
And what was the consequence?
Why, God heard his cry, and says David, "`He inclined unto me.`"
Here was a real experience and real discernment of the Divine operation,
increasing upon him as he _waited_ patiently for it.
Well, he adds, "`He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay,
and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.`"
Truly, "`the steps of a good man, are ordered of the Lord.`"
For indeed, "`it is not in man that walketh, to direct his steps.`"
This was David`'s experience.
For, as he _did not make haste,_ did not run of himself, but _waited,_ and that _patiently,_
upon God, he found his course directed, his _steps_ ordered, his _goings established,_
by the Lord Himself, and not by his own wisdom, strength, or creaturely fervency.

Now let us attend to what David obtained further, and we shall find,
that after getting thus established upon the eternal, unshaken rock,
and not on the sandy foundation of creaturely devotion,
he had __"`a new song__ put into his mouth.`"
Oh! the blessedness of _waiting patiently_ upon the Lord for His coming and direction,
be it longer or shorter that we have thus to wait.
Had David grown weary of _waiting,_ had his patience failed him, whilst his Lord tarried,
he might readily have set himself to work, willed, run,
and even have taken some _old song_ into his mouth.
But this would all have been on the sandy foundation, not on the rock of ages.
This would have been attempting to order his own steps, and establish his own goings,
even though he might, in words, have asked God to do it.
But as he chose rather to _wait patiently_ the Lord`'s time, and until he evidently felt,
and knew Him to _incline unto him,_ he was favoured with a _new song._
Oh! this is vastly different from an _old one,_
which is only in the line of others`' experience, made ready to our hand.
And why was it _new?_
Because __the Lord "`put it into his mouth,`"__ as he says expressly.
He did not _take_ it into his own mouth, as many now do, in the _oldness of the letter,_
but waited till the God on whom he relied, put it into his mouth, _in the newness of life._
Well, therefore, might he sing "`living praise to our God.`"

He who runs into prayer, preaching, etc., before Christ, the Life,
livingly moves him thereto, makes _haste,_ and is not therein a _true believer._
Every true believer believes in, and waits for, the _living coming in spirit,_
and qualifications of Christ, his life.
It is Christ that liveth and acteth in him.

A few weeks after this, to wit, the 25th of the 4th month,
in writing a little piece on a special occasion,
after particularly and affectionately mentioning the tender feelings and
emotions of my heart towards several particular friends and acquaintances,
my soul seemed overwhelmed with love and almost unutterable
good-will to the people of the Lord,
wherever scattered, the world over;
in the fresh flowings whereof I enlarged nearly as follows: "`But above all, O Zion,
thou city of the living God! what I shall say to thee! all that is alive
within me is moved at thy being now brought into my remembrance!
How shall I express the overflowings of that love which I now feel for thee?
or that ardently travailing exercise,
which in the rolling of tender bowels engages my soul for thy everlasting welfare!
May the Lord of Hosts encamp round about thee, as a wall of fire for thy defence.
Mayst thou know an abiding in thy tents, O Israel!
Let not the earth, nor all its enchantments, entice thee from the cross, O Israel!
The Lord alone can keep thee, and he only is worthy of thy closest attention.

"`Keep near, keep near, O chosen generation, keep near thy Divine teacher,
who is graciously vouchsafing to teach thee Himself!

"`Dwell deep, O ye travailing souls; give not back; go on with him that hath called you,
although it may be through fire and water, through frowns and reproaches:
the everlasting Arm will be underneath to support you, as you make God your refuge,
and continue faithful in the glorious work of reformation
which he is fitting some of you for.
My life in tenderness runs out towards you: ye are as bone of my bone,
and flesh of my flesh.
Oh! may the Lord protect and preserve you;
may the blessings of the everlasting hills rest upon you;
and especially upon such of you as have been as it were separated from your brethren,
and devoted to the great work of the Lord in the earth.
And be ye assured,
if ye hold fast the beginning of your confidence and engagement steadfastly to the end,
no weapon formed against you shall ever prosper;
the tongue that riseth in judgment against you shall be condemned,
and even though Gog and Magog wage war and oppose you,
the Lamb and his followers shall have the victory.`"
As I have good grounds to believe this was written in "`the good-will
of him who dwelt in the bush,`" I feel easy to transcribe it here,
and give it a place in these memoirs.

[.blurb]
=== Oldness of Letter and Newness of Life

+++[+++1777]
First day, 14th of 12th month, George Dillwyn and Benjamin Jones from New Jersey,
on a religious visit to our parts, attended our meeting,
and Thomas Arnold and myself accompanied them to Cranston, West and East Greenwich,
and Warwick.
We had some solid satisfaction in these meetings, especially the last,
wherein it was very evident to me that a divine visitation was
eminently extended to some of the youth and others present.
But, alas! though they were livingly invited to seek the Lord,
and serve Him with full purpose of heart, little appearance of real religious exercise,
has since been remarkable among them.
The world, and the things thereof, seem to maintain the government of their affections,
which indeed is sorrowfully too much the case in other places; the life of religion is,
in consequence thereof, but little known and enjoyed by many, very many, in our society,
even those of a plain outward appearance, and, in many things, of exemplary lives.

The power of seduction has in all ages been exertive
in settling poor man into a dependence upon a regular,
orderly conduct, moral uprightness and integrity, with the performance of certain real,
or supposed duties, which, however good and necessary any of them may be in themselves,
have never made the comers thereunto, or the performers thereof, perfect.
For, let us think of whatever duty we will, as performed in man`'s own strength,
though with ever so great professions of strict obedience to the law and will of God;
it is, and ever will be, as true of such duty, as ever it was of circumcision,
"`he is not a`" true spiritual Jew, "`who is`" ever so strictly, uprightly,
and zealously, "`one outwardly; neither is`" the effectual "`circumcision,
that which is outward`" in the flesh.
But he is the true Jew "`who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart,
in the spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not of man, but of God.`"

Oh! how have I mourned to see how men of all societies are resting in the letter, yea,
in the "`oldness of the letter,`" therein doing and performing something or other,
that they are too much trusting in,
though they know little or nothing of the real _newness of Life,_
nor are acting and doing in the fresh spring thereof.
And whatever any plain Friend, or zealous Baptist, or any other professor,
may think of their state, because of their punctual observance,
and exact performance of any ceremonious duty whatever,
even to the most rigid compliance with all that can
be reached in the oldness of the letter,
it will forever remain as true of all this, as of circumcision and uncircumcision:
neither the one nor the other, neither the most earnest attachment to,
and performance of them, nor the most careful omission of, and fixed opposition to them,
any of them,
except only in the fresh spring and "`newness of
life,`" _is anything at all rightly in religion;_
but the _new creature,_ and what is done by the new creature, and in and by the _new life,_
in the new and living faith,
which is truly the "`faith of the operation of God,`" in and upon the soul,
and not a mere belief, _is all in all._

[.blurb]
=== Formality--a Contrast

Oh! the deadness and dryness of the works and obedience, the duties and devotions,
of the great bulk of Christian professors, in the several societies!
Each can see formality in the members of others, but too few suspect it in themselves.
I think I clearly see, that dead formality is as prevalent in many of our plain Friends,
and constant attenders of our meetings,
and such who are scrupulously honest in all their dealings, exact in their moral conduct,
and who also can join in condemning the formality of most other societies,
as it is in those they so freely condemn.
I don`'t mean that the manner of their condemning
the formality of others is uncharitable or blameable,
or without real pertinency; but I mean, that a degree of formality as dangerous,
and as unseen by themselves, prevails with many of our members, even, outwardly,
very orderly walkers, and such as think that sitting down in silence,
is far more acceptable to God, than words uttered in man`'s time, strength, and wisdom.

I know of nothing more acceptable to God, nor more useful, instructive,
and strengthening to the souls of men, than true silent worship,
and waiting on God for help immediately from His holy presence;
nor of scarcely any thing more formal and lifeless, than that dull, unfeeling silence,
which too many of our society are satisfying themselves with, the year round,
and from year to year.

[.blurb]
=== The Life--That is the Thing

Oh! it is the Life, the Life, that is the thing! and this is too little witnessed,
or even rightly waited for, by many.
Some are not content with such vocal services, as God, by His Holy Spirit,
quickens and immediately qualifies for the performance of,
but are busily and zealously doing a great deal of themselves,
and in their own puttings forth: all which brings them not a whit nearer to God,
nor further on in the true Christian experience and stability.

Others, who see this pretty clearly to be so, are yet sitting at ease,
in a state as little profitable to themselves as others.
They see through the emptiness of many outward performances, and creaturely exertions;
and therefore suppose themselves much more refined,
and nearer the true and spiritual worship;
and yet scarcely know any thing of that burial "`by baptism into death`" with Christ,
and that rising with Him, and in Him,
in "`the newness of Life,`" wherein alone true gospel worship, in spirit and in truth,
is performed.
And what can be said or done to awaken the one or the other of these sorts of formalists,
from their false rest in the letter, and in the outward-court worship, that so,
being awakened from sleep, and raised from death and formality,
Christ may "`give them light,`" and in and by the shining thereof,
guide them into the inner temple,
and engage them in the spiritual worship and devotion thereof!
Indeed, if this were to become their happy experience,
they would soon see that by the deeds of the law, no flesh can be saved.
No possible performances in the oldness of the letter, and in creaturely ability, will do.
It is only in the fresh spring of divine life, and under its quickening influence,
that any of our duties and obedience, finds full acceptance with God,
or advances us in substantial knowledge and goodness.

"`There is none,`" essentially, and in himself, __"`good,__ but one; that is, God.`"
All the good that others have, do, or can attain to,
is only by communication and influence from Him, the source of all real goodness.
He is the worker of all our good works in us.
"`We are His workmanship, created anew in Christ Jesus, unto good works.`"
The preparation of the heart, and answer of the tongue`" are from Him alone.
Therefore, let all wait upon Him, feel after Him, and draw near unto Him,
in Spirit and in truth; so will He draw near unto them, enliven, and quality them,
for every good word, work, and service.
They will not dare to run of themselves, without, or before,
nor stay idly behind His leadings.
By waiting for His help and putting forth, they will acknowledge,
that He works all their works _in them;_ and that they are _really,_
and not only _professionally,_ His workmanship, in all they know, act,
and experience in religion.
And, at the same time, by a lively cooperation with Him in the work,
and when He worketh in them,
and therein by a diligent working out of their own salvation, through Him,
and alone in and by His immediate help and influence, they will also acknowledge,
that it is not merely unto an opinion, which they call faith, nor unto forms, ceremonies,
and outward performances but strictly, truly, and livingly,
__"`unto good works,`"__ that He creates them anew in Christ Jesus.

Here the "`twain are made one.`"
Here "`the man is not without the woman: nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.`"
Here, "`it is God, that worketh in us.`"
And it is truly we, that, through this His working and influence in us,
work out our own salvation.
And "`what God has thus joined together,
let no man put asunder,`" or think to be saved by
any thing that can be done without his own cooperation;
nor yet, that of himself, he can do any, the least thing, as of himself,
towards his salvation.

[.blurb]
=== Field of Labour Opened

Having, some time before this, dismissed my school at Providence,
I opened one at Smithfield, on the 12th of the 11th month, 1778, under the care,
inspection,
and direction of a solid committee appointed by the Monthly Meeting for that purpose.

Soon after this, I took several colds one after another, until at length,
on the 26th of the 2nd month, leaving our Monthly Meeting,
being quite unable to sit through it, I went to my sister`'s,
where I was confined several weeks, brought very low,
and at times ready to doubt my recovery.
Indeed many of my friends and relations pretty much gave over expecting it.
I was, after a season of deep exercise and probation,
enabled to resign up life and all into the hands of Him who made me,
and to say in sincerity, Thy will be done in life or death.

As I lay one night in great distress of body, and deep thoughtfulness of mind,
I was drawn into an awful view of death, eternity, and eternal judgment,
in a manner that I never had before;
but feeling my mind perfectly resigned to depart
this life and launch into an endless eternity,
if so the Lord my God should please to order it,
and finding all pain of body and anxiety of mind removed, I lay still some time,
thinking probably I might ere long be released from all the pangs and toils of time,
into the glorious rejoicings of eternal Life.
But after a considerable length of time had passed
in inward and profound stillness and adoration,
large fields of labour were opened,
and I saw that I must travel from place to place in this
and distant lands in the Lord`'s commission and service.
From this time I never entertained a doubt of my recovery,
although I had afterwards a return or two of the disorder more severe than before;
for these openings were in the fresh evidence of divine Life, which never deceived me.
A fulness of Divine favour, in the sheddings abroad of the love of God in my heart,
remained fresh and living with me through most of the remaining time of my illness.
After a few days I began to recover, and pretty soon got a little about again,
and before a great while, attained my usual state of health.
May thanksgiving, and glory,
and honour be ever ascribed by my soul to Him who
has been with me in sickness and in health,
supporting and preserving me in both, and enabling me to resign to His divine disposal.
May I ever live answerable to such regard of the Highest to me a poor worm of the dust.
My soul has been bowed,
self has been abased and through deep prostration I have been made to joy in the Lord,
and rejoice in the salvation of my God and Saviour.

=== A Demand for Taxes

About the latter end of the 6th month this year, an old acquaintance of mine,
being now collector of rates, came and demanded one of me.
I asked him what it was for?
He said, to sink the paper money.
I told him, as that money was made expressly for the purpose of carrying on war,
I had refused to take it; and for the same reason could not pay a tax to sink it,
believing it my duty to bear testimony against war and fighting.
I informed him, that for divers years past, even divers years before the war began,
and when I had no expectation of ever being tried in this way,
it had been a settled belief with me, that it was not right to pay such taxes;
at least not right for me, nor, in my apprehension, right in itself;
though many sincere brethren may not at present see its
repugnancy to the pure and peaceable spirit of the gospel.
I let him know I did not wish to put him to any trouble,
but would be glad to pay it if I could consistently
with my firm persuasion of duty to my God.
He appeared moderate, thoughtful, and rather tender;
and after a time of free and pretty full conversation upon the subject,
went away in a pleasant disposition of mind, I being truly glad to see him so.
Divers such demands were made of me in those troublesome times, for divers years.
I ever found it best to be very calm and candid: and to open,
as I was from time to time enabled, the genuine grounds of my refusal;
and that if possible,
so as to reach the divers understandings of those who made the demand.

Sometimes, through holy help,
I have rejoiced in perceiving that the Divine Witness in their hearts,
has been so reached, as to rise up in them an advocate for the innocency, uprightness,
and christian propriety of my conduct, and conscientious scruples and persuasion.
I believe I was ever preserved in such meekness,
as never to say or do anything that raised anger or resentment in any of them.
They ever heard me with attention, appeared unwilling to distress me,
spoke to me in moderation, and left me without distraining any thing from me.
And although I could hear of their getting very warm and angry with some Friends,
who I feared were a little rough with them, they were constantly quiet,
mild and gentle with me.
And though they frequently made heavy distraints, even to very considerable amounts,
upon many of our friends, and that to the distressing of some of their families;
yet they never took a farthing from me,
though I refused entirely to pay any part of divers taxes demanded of me:
as also a greater or less proportion of divers others,
according as I found them more or less for war-charges.
Indeed, I continued to decline the payment, in part or whole,
for years after most other Friends made no scruple to pay them:
because I found very considerable mixtures of war-charges in them,
for some years after the war was over, and therefore could not be easy to pay them.
Notwithstanding they told me I was singular and alone,
and that all other Friends paid them, they still treated me very respectfully;
and though some of them would say, they could not afford to lose it,
but must make distraint, and even appointed times when they would come again and do it,
yet none of them ever did it.
These things I record in thankful acknowledgment,
and commemoration of the Lord`'s gracious dealings with me,
and for encouragement of others to a strict faithfulness to all His requirings.

[.blurb]
=== War-taxes--a Faithful People to be Raised Up

I may now express a little of what has lived in my mind, as a fixed belief, viz.,
that a people will one day be raised up,
by Him who is the great Father of the family and governor of the world,
to bear a faithful testimony, in His eternal power, against the payment of such taxes.
And this one thing I have no doubt of, that if Friends walk humbly enough,
and dwell enough in the inward, attentive, feeling, and discerning state,
to discover and discern the signs of the times;
to hear the voice and call of the true Shepherd,
and follow Him faithfully wherever He leadeth;
they will hear the call and invitation to this necessary work and service: and,
if obedient, this testimony will be committed unto them to bear.

The Lord, who is ever attentive to the good of souls and the exaltation of His kingdom,
is on His way, and truth will more fully break forth;
righteousness will come into dominion;
the mountain of the Lord`'s house will surely be established above all the other mountains;
but many of the called, through want of faithful attention to the call,
may never become the chosen, and so never come forth valiantly in the testimony,
nor stand immovable, nor triumph victoriously, in the Lamb`'s warfare.

I think I have seen in the light,
that too many that have come forth in a degree of true heavenly beauty,
and through the furnace, being in some degree refined,
have afterwards loved this present world, delighted in its friendship,
rejoiced in earthly accumulations, and too much let go their hold on heavenly good.
Alas, for these! if they were but as diligent, watchful,
and solicitous for Zion`'s welfare, and to lay up treasures in heaven,
as they are to gather something on earth,
they would be sure to grow rich in faith and good works,
and become heirs of the heavenly kingdom.
These can never,
so long as their rejoicings are so much in earth`'s enchanting pursuits and acquisitions,
rightly bear truth`'s holy testimony, or lift up its standard to the nations.
Nay, nay: this state prepares them at best to bear a superficial, lifeless testimony;
but very commonly to reason, argue, and dispute, and that too, as they think,
very wisely, against the rising, spreading,
and increase of the testimony and government of the Prince of Peace.

They even seal the stone, and set a watch to prevent _him_ from coming forth,
who is "`the resurrection and the life.`"
Not professedly so.
The Jews called Him a deceiver, a blasphemer.
The state they were in, prevented their knowing Him.
Had they rightly known Him, they would not have crucified Him.
Truth is seldom or never opposed as truth, but as error.
And the Jew outward, in every divided sect or society in Christendom,
is just as blind now, and insensible of Christ, of what is, and what is not of Him,
as the Jew outward then was.
The different periods of time make no alteration; names make none.
It is life, and the real inward state of people`'s minds, that make the alterations,
as to their knowledge of Christ, and reception of Him, in His way, coming,
and appearance; and prepare them to stand faithful in His testimony from time to time,
and in whatever He opens to, and requires of them, whether in things new or old,
and by which they are enabled to discern with clearness the signs of the times,
in all His unfoldings and dispensations.

[.blurb]
=== Danger of Stifling the Life

If there is not a diligent waiting at wisdom`'s gate, and in the valley of humiliation,
in the true faith and patience of the saints,
the sense of divine things is gradually lessened and lost; and instead thereof,
a kind of wise reasoning takes place, wherein the divine Life, and its blessed testimony,
are stifled and rejected; and those who stand faithful therein,
are censured and condemned.
"`Ye do always resist the Holy Ghost; as your fathers did,
so do ye,`" will ever be applicable to all in the same state, in every age,
and in every society.
"`Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?`"
And which of them now, who stand their ground in Truth`'s testimony,
will not be persecuted in some mode or other?
"`He that is born after the flesh, will persecute him that is born after the spirit.`"
Hence the truth and propriety of this declaration:
"`If ye will live godly in Christ Jesus, ye must suffer in persecution.`"

Oh! that professors of all names were rightly aware of it.
Each society can very readily conceive the danger of it in others:
but few are enough aware of it at home, and in themselves.
It will hold good in all cases, where the love of the world, ease, honour,
or creaturely activity, suppresses the pure and living sense of the holy,
innocent life of truth.
There is great probability, that in proportion as people grow up in this state,
into influence, rule, and authority, in any society,
however refined their principles and profession,
they will become opposers of Christ in His sincere followers,
and in His peculiar designs, openings, and dispensations,
and do what in them lies to prevent the spreading of divine light and reformation;
even though they may be very zealously engaged in their way,
in exertions to promote the cause of truth, as they think,
in many branches of its already established testimonies.

Oh! the deception which this state is ever liable to!
It gropes in darkness, and cannot find the right way of the Lord.
For God Himself lays the stumbling block in the way of those,
who choose and rush into this state; and that on purpose "`that they may stumble,
and be snared and taken.`"
He will hide His mysteries from every state but that
of "`the little child,`" the babe and suckling.
Unto these He reveals, and will reveal them: and when He does so,
they are often tried and afflicted with the oppositions
and hard sayings of many in the other state,
who scarcely ever suspect themselves of being grown up in, and acting from,
the same life and disposition,
which ever opposed the pure testimony of truth in
those who were given up all to follow the Lamb,
in all His leadings.

[.blurb]
=== Antichrist and the Visited of the Lord--A Vision

I have seen it in the light of Christ, that if there be not a diligent waiting for,
and giving up to the leadings of divine Light and Life,
the kingdom of Antichrist will gain ground for a season,
even among the once visited and called of the Lord.
The Church will lose her beauty, strength, and authority, for a while,
even until greater and due attention, integrity, and holiness, shall prevail.
By little and little, her members will mix and unite with the world, and worldly spirit,
till her brightness fade away, her discerning depart from her,
and a night of darkness overtake and come upon her.
My heart`'s desire and prayer to God have been fervent, night and day,
that this may never be her case.
And I have at times a reviving hope, that as a general thing it never may.
But confirmed I am, wherever it is not her sad and sorrowful situation and condition,
it must be prevented by timely and persevering diligence, watchfulness, humility,
and heavenly mindedness.
And that thus it may be prevented, and that she may, in the general,
and in all her particular branches, be preserved in strength, purity, and comeliness,
"`clothed with the sun,
the moon under her feet,`" crowned and adorned with her crown of twelve bright stars,
full of light and glory, is the secret, yet fervent prayer and travail of my soul,
in deep prostration before the God of all grace and preservation.

May his holy Name, from age to age, be kept sacred among us as a people,
indeed among all people.
May it ever be known as a strong tower of safety.
May our fleeing be constantly to it, in life, substance, and reality,
and not in mere profession, and creaturely zeal and activity:
that so the pure standard of truth, from generation to generation,
may be exalted and maintained in our Zion, henceforward and forever.
And, O thou exercised travailing soul, whoever thou art, hold on thy way;
hold fast thine integrity;
be not discouraged at the lukewarmness or want of true judgment and discerning in others;
but be thou valiant for the cause of truth in thy day; and then,
notwithstanding all the opposition thou mayest meet with, within or without,
the Lord will be thy shepherd; the holy One of Israel will watch over, protect,
and defend thee; and as thou leanest wholly to the arm of His help,
and trustest steadfastly in His divine light for thy leader,
He will surely uphold and sustain thee through all
thy combats and fiery trials in this militant state;
and when thy faithful warfare here below is fully accomplished,
He will receive thee into His glorious, church triumphant,
there forever to join the shouts and hallelujahs of saints and angels
in a glorious and unspeakable participation and fruition of perfect blessedness.

[.blurb]
=== Flinching from Strict Plainness

I have now freedom to commit to writing,
a little of what I have often thought respecting the custom among Friends,
of calling one another friend, as friend Rodman, friend Arnold, etc.,
instead of calling them by their proper given names.
I think it deserves serious consideration,
why this way of speaking to those whose names we are acquainted with,
is adopted or continued in.
Is it not to shun the cross?
or because calling persons by their names, John, James, Peter, etc., sounds too unmodish;
or as some may think, too clownish, and others, too disrespectful?
Is there nothing of the spirit of the world in thus
flinching from strict plainness and simplicity?
Is there no tincture of pride, or worldly honour in it?
Does it not spring from, please,
and centre in the same spirit which produces that superabundance of vain compliments,
and mere shadows of respect, which prevail in the world?
Whence proceeds Mr. such a one, and Mrs.
such a one, and a multiplicity of other forms of address?
Is it not from the want of true self-denial?
Is not their origin from a proud and unsubjected
will or life?--a spirit or disposition that despises,
or is ashamed to act, and appear in the meekness and simplicity of Jesus,
our heavenly pattern, and of His primitive and mortified followers?
Are not humility, abasement, and primitive simplicity, looked down upon with contempt,
by many of the great professors, and even teachers of this age?
They glory to call Christ their Lord, but will not have Him to reign over them.
They profess Him their leader but walk counter to the teachings of his Holy Spirit,
as also to His blessed example, and excellent instructions.

[.blurb]
=== Rank Phariseeism

Far be it for me to wish any to make more of these things than they really are:
or to stick, settle, or trust in them.
Some appear vainly to think, if they get to be very plain and regular outwardly,
they have a right to think pretty well of their state.
And, alas! too many place much of religion in little outside things, as dress, language,
forms, etc., little better in themselves than tithing mint and rue, and the like;
and though they have very little of the true Life, and inward, living spring of religion,
are yet vainly built up in self-estimation, look upon others,
not quite so outside-religious, with disapprobation, and are secretly saying,
"`Stand by thyself, I am holier than thou.`"
I know of scarcely any state among men, more remote from true Christianity,
harder to reach,
or more painfully depressing to the livingly exercised in true gospel-travail,
than this rank Phariseeism.
Indeed, it is natural for minds not much experienced in true religion,
when once they begin to find a real necessity to submit the outside to the humbling,
forming influence of the Cross,
to verge into a reliance on outside reformations and mortifications,
and to grow censorious, rigid, conceited, and self-righteous.
I have, with so much pain and regret, felt and seen it, in numerous instances,
that I have often been afraid to recommend the necessary attention to,
and faithfulness in these external things, lest an apprehension of their intrinsic value,
and substantial goodness in themselves,
should debase the mind into that deplorable state
of outside pharisaical holiness above mentioned.

I often find even libertines more susceptible of truth`'s
humbling and heart-tendering reaches and impressions,
than these rigid, self-righteous, outside professors.
For, dry and lifeless as the latter are,
they are generally very confident that they are the people.
And Oh! that none of them may indulge an idea that wisdom will die with them.

[.blurb]
=== Christ in the Pharisee`'s House

There is much Divine instruction in the account of Jesus going into the house of a Pharisee,
to eat meat, when the woman washed His feet with her tears,
and wiped them with the hairs of her head.
It seems she had been a sinner; and the regular, exact Pharisee,
condemned both her and her Lord;--__her,__ as a sinner,
and because she was not so exact and outwardly circumspect as himself; and __Him,__ because,
as he vainly thought, He did not know what she was.
For, surely, thought he, in his whole, exact, and secure condition,
if this man were a prophet, He would have known who, and what manner of woman this is,
that is so free with Him, '`for she is a sinner,`' a libertine,
one who has not paid such scrupulous regard to, nor been so zealously affected with,
the outside regulations and exact observance of the law, as he and others like him were;
for his and their religion lay in these things.
And yet, libertine, as she had before been,
it seems she had now become so broken and tendered,
under a sense of her undone condition,
and so deeply affected and engaged about the great things of her soul`'s salvation, that,
in presence of the Saviour of souls,
and under the animating influence of His mighty power upon her,
the tears so plentifully flowed from her eyes, that she even washed His feet with them.

And yet so unmoved and insensible, was the narrow-hearted Pharisee, the formal,
outside professor, that all this afforded him no evidence or conviction,
of her penitential frame of mind; nor of her Lord`'s true discernment, goodness,
and benevolence.
He was so swallowed up in his outside holiness, that blindness prevailed upon him.
He was not able to behold the beauty and humiliation of her contrited soul,
and how unspeakably it excelled his dry, flat, and formal exactness,
and lifeless devotion.
Jesus, who knew their hearts, pointed out to him, what _she_ had,
and what _he_ had not done to _Him,_ since He came under his roof,
in terms sufficiently plain and striking to have convinced him,
had he been open to Truth`'s holy instructions,
and feelingly susceptible of its heart-enlivening influences,
and of the great excellency of true tenderness and contrition,
above all possible exactness of outside regularity.

Let none suppose this gives liberty to deviate from a life of daily self-denial,
even in outward conformity to the plainness and simplicity of the gospel;
for the language of the holy Teacher is, "`These ought ye to have done,
and not to leave the other undone.`"
Many suppose this passage, and that of the publican, who smote on his breast,
begged mercy as a sinner,
and went down to his house justified rather than the exact and praying,
fasting and alms-giving Pharisee,
give countenance to vile and hardened publicans and sinners to hope,
if they do but vocally confess their sins, in however formal, insensible, impenitent,
and lifeless a manner, that their state is pretty well;
that they are in a better condition,
than such as are honestly endeavouring to have their whole life, conduct,
and conversation, conformed to the counsel and will of God;
and that Christ will accept and save them,
because they profess to renounce all their own righteousness, and trust wholly in His,
for salvation.

[.blurb]
=== Salvation from Sin

Oh fools!
He accepts nor saves any,
further than their souls are sanctified and redeemed from the filth of sin.
Sin remaining in any soul, in a greater or less degree,
is an absolute separation of that soul from a state of reconciliation with God.
He cannot possibly be reconciled to any degree of sin, nor to a soul in sin.
Salvation is ever _from_ sin, not merely from the imputation of it,
but from the very life and influence of it.

Sin is in direct opposition to God.
It is a life and will in the soul, in counter-action to His holy life and will,
and to His secret operations on the soul.

This is the very life, nature, and essence of sin.
This is what makes any act, habit, disposition, or indulgence, sinful.
Christ came in the flesh, that sin might be made to appear exceeding sinful.
He appears in us, in living testimony against, and condemnation of, all sin:
and by His light, still shows it to be sinful, in that it is in opposition to,
and counteracts His heart-cleansing influence our souls.

If at any time we were unreconciled to God, because of our sins, we shall forever be so,
unless, or until they are absolutely done away.
And done away they never can be, so long as that contrariety to divine light,
manifestation, and operation, remaineth in us, which ever made them sinful.

The poor, penitent, weeping woman, and the poor publican smiting on his breast,
and begging for mercy, were in a very different state from that of the common, lifeless,
unfeeling confession of sins, which abounds among professors, in our day,
who are very faintly striving, if at all, to overcome sin;
very easy under the contaminating influence and bondage of it,
and who profess boldly their full expectation of living all the days of their life in it,
and yet claim salvation by the merits of a crucified Saviour,
a Saviour who never saved a single soul,
a whit further than that soul was truly sanctified and cleansed from sin.
Sin ever must, and ever will be imputed to every soul,
so far as the life of it prevails in him;
and the merits of Christ can be no further or otherwise
imputed to the reconciliation of souls unto God,
than they are restored and cleansed from that which caused their alienation from Him.
He is unchangeable, and eternally as much unreconciled to a soul, or a sinner,
at one time as another, in the same state.
He can never possibly change into a state of reconciliation with any soul,
that remains in that actual filth, or sin, on account of which,
he was ever unreconciled to Him.

[.blurb]
=== Retirement

This morning I waited on the Lord, in inward silent retirement and travail of soul,
as was my usual and very useful practice.
Yet, in the course of the day, I gave way to too much lightness in conversation;
for which judgment and condemnation came over me.
And in the evening, the family sitting awhile in silence,
my mind was much humbled under a sense of my unworthiness and instability,
even to deep mourning and shedding of tears.
Indeed,
I have never found any more ready and effectual way
to have my sins set in clear order before me,
and my heart rightly contrited under a sense of them,
than to retire from all the noises and bustles of the world,
and from all the tumults of my own mind, to the gift of God in the soul,
the unflattering, and yet never falsely-accusing Witness, which he has placed there, or,
placed us in a lively and feeling sense of it,
as we are enough inward and attentive to it.

In these days I often renewed covenant with my God, sat much alone, kept silence,
and bore His yoke and rod upon me.
Many days I spent nearly, if not quite, without condemnation; and I believe without sin:
though many others were so spent as to cause more or less of anxiety and woe:
but I even found the ministration of condemnation was truly glorious,
because it prepared my mind for, and led to,
the more glorious ministration of justification.
Fervent was the engagement of my mind; and often my peace flowed like a river,
and Zion`'s welfare swallowed up almost all other considerations and concerns.
Much travail did I often feel for the preservation
and growth of the Lord`'s visited children,
I mean those who had become livingly sensible of
the operations of His divine power upon their spirits;
and to some of these I wrote once in while an encouraging or persuasive letter.
A considerable number of these I have by me, but to avoid swelling these memoirs,
I omit them here,
as also a great part of the minutes and memorandums which I made of my exercises,
watchings, strivings, and trials in those days.

In the time of waiting on the Lord in silent retirement alone,
which was mostly my daily practice,
it sometimes pleased Him to veil His holy presence from me,
in order to prove my patience and steadfast reliance upon Him:
and sometimes to command a solemn, awful silence in me,
wherein He often stood revealed in majestic all-sufficiency before me,
in a manner which I have no words to convey a clear idea
of to any who have not experienced the same in themselves.
But I am assured that all, who rightly wait upon Him in their own minds,
will find Him a God nigh at hand,
and graciously disposed to replenish and satisfy the hungry soul.
I do not believe a man can go aside, and sit down alone,
to make the experiment merely to see what the consequence of sitting in silence will be,
without a real hunger and heartfelt travail,
and therein be favoured with the flowings of the holy oil;
but none ever wait rightly and perseveringly upon God in vain.
The incomes of His love afford more true joy, than all earth`'s richest enjoyments.
"`A feast of fat things,
of wines on the lees well refined,`" is the comfortable portion of His chosen.

[.blurb]
=== Real Holiness Attainable--Abiding in the Furnace

In these awful approaches,
I beheld at times with clearness the kind hand of
the Lord in leading me through many deep probations.
I viewed His overturning influence among men, in these outwardly troublesome times;
and now and then my prospects were livingly extended, in great good-will,
and rolling of bowels, towards the church in general, and some places in particular,
with a living evidence sealed on my heart, that, if I abode faithful,
I must devote considerable time in the service of the Gospel in my day and generation.
I saw much dross and tin, and even reprobate silver,
to be purged away before we should be a pure people; and that God in His goodness,
would turn against, or rather stand unalterably opposed to, everything in us, however
specious in religious appearance, that has not the sanction of His fiery law upon it;
that through all generations His baptism of fire
will keep burning in those who quench it not,
till nothing remains in them, but what can "`dwell with devouring fire,
and everlasting burnings,`" and that nothing else can ever enter His holy kingdom.

I saw, beyond all doubt, that a state of real holiness may be attained in this life,
and will be, by all who resist not the Holy Spirit, given them to profit withal.
I had an assurance,
that a people would be yet raised up that would walk with God in white; and who,
through judgment and burning, would be so united to Him, in an everlasting covenant,
as that many would become pillars in His house,
that should not be thence removed again forever.
For they would abide with Him in the furnace,
under that operation whereby He subdues all things in His people to Himself,
until Christ delivers up all things to the Father, and God becomes all in all.

These things are true, sure, and substantial:
though seen and rightly believed only in the light and of the Lamb,
and in the fellowship of Jesus; and therefore neither seen nor believed by multitudes,
who are loud in profession of faith in his blood:
because that profession whilst they are wholly outward in their views,
can do no more towards opening divine mysteries, than a profession of faith in Mahomet.

My soul, and all alive within me,
under the animating influence of these openings and prospects,
at seasons bowed in reverent prostration before Emmanuel, God with us.
The very windows of heaven seemed opened, and the fountains of the great deep broken up.
The new song was put into my mouth! and I sang hallelujahs to the Lord God and the Lamb.

[.blurb]
=== The Remorse of a Soldier

+++[+++1778]
9th month 4th. Sat silent this morning in retirement,
with much more satisfaction than I feel in too much conversation;--then to school.

5th and 6th. Sat in silence; then to school.

On the 7th of 9th month, had conversation with a man who had been to see his son,
whose leg was lately shot off above the knee, in the engagement on Rhode Island.
He told me he saw also another wounded young man,
who informed him that just before he received his wound,
he had discharged his gun at another man of the adverse party,
and that immediately after he saw him fall, wringing his hands;
upon which he said he was immediately filled with horror,
and thought he should never dare to charge his gun again for war.
But while he stood thus filled with horror to think he had killed a man,
there came a ball and gave him a wound.
He further said, if he ever got well he never would go into the war again.

Thus we see the Lord can smite the stout-hearted warrior with horror and amazement,
under a sense of the blackness of that guilt, which,
in violation of the laws of the Prince of Peace, and the sweet precepts of the gospel,
leads men to murder one another, by hundreds and thousands,
for the sake of the mammon of this world.
Oh! lamentable! lamentable!
May their eyes be opened to see the unrighteousness of such conduct!
The law allowed of war and fighting; but the _gospel_ utterly forbids both.
The super-excellency of the gospel dispensation above that of the law,
was conspicuously displayed when Jesus taught the
better way than of resisting force by force;
and taking eye for eye,`" by positively commanding, "`Resist not evil,`" etc.
May the fighters in this day, who call themselves Christians, seriously ask themselves:
"`Are we under the law or under grace?
Do we not value ourselves upon being, not under the law, but under grace?
Have we not miserably fallen short of what the gospel enjoins,
and turned back to the old law to prove the lawfulness of what the gospel forbids?
Or can we find one text in the New Testament that in any wise countenances carnal war?
But do we not find many that discountenance it?
Nay, is not the whole drift of the New Testament against any thing of the nature of violence,
revenge, and war?
Can we, then, be Christians, and live in open rebellion against the laws of Christ?`"

[.blurb]
=== Preaching for hire

Truly, my very soul mourns,
and my very heart yearns over the dismal situation and state of miserable,
deluded Christendom, which, though high in profession, is taught,
by those who should know better, to violate the doctrine of the Prince of Peace.
And, alas! there is great reason to fear that Antichrist`'s
reign on earth will continue in triumph and dominion,
till God arise and deliver poor mankind from the poison of these antichristian teachers,
who, though they may think hard to be told of it,
are the very props of the kingdom of darkness "`teaching for hire,
and divining for money.`"
So long as this is the case, we have no reason to expect,
but that they will divine or teach such things as will please those who pay them:
for a man would not expect to be paid for preaching
against the inclinations of those who hired him.
If they say, preach war,
how can he expect to please them by preaching the gospel of peace?
Those who hire, think they may order the hired.
And, alas! this sort of hirelings are very orderly in preaching to suit those who pay them.
I believe many young ministers, when they first begin,
think they never will depart from the purity of the gospel;
but "`the love of money`" being the "`root of all evil,`" we may be assured,
_that man_ whose ministry is supported by money, paid for preaching,
does better than one in a thousand if he be not corrupted.

I have seen, I believe,
in the light of the Lord that when Antichrist`'s kingdom is completely overthrown,
preaching up war, and making a trade of preaching to get money by,
will both be utterly abolished,
and remembered with wonder that ever they could have a place among professed Christians.
They will be considered, as in truth they are, as the works of the night of apostasy,
which can have no place but in darkness; for the Light condemns them.
I believe the Lord will open people`'s eyes to see beyond them:
and that He will gather some,
in this and succeeding ages to serve Him "`in newness
of life,`" and will carry on his work in the earth,
till the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of Christ; and peace, harmony,
and happiness, will reign among His chosen.

A day or two after this, as I sat in silence, drawing near to God,
I saw the insufficiency of all human endeavours to worship or please Him,
without the assistance of His Holy Spirit,
to enable us first to know and then to do His will.

=== False Prophets

Come, reader, consider a little.
Did the true prophets steadily cry _woe,_ against the false?
Did the false abound through all former ages?
Did they overrun the church in the time of Christ`'s appearance in that body?
Did he most cunningly expose and condemn them?
And dost thou suppose our age, or our country, is clear of them?
I tell thee, nay.
The land now swarms with them, in our time, and in our corner of the earth.
I see them, and I know them, from place to place, almost wherever I go.
I am as sure they are ministers of Antichrist, as I am of anything in the Gospel.
They do the same which Christ accused their brethren of in that day.
They take away the key of knowledge, and substitute human acquirements, notions, systems,
and performances.
They "`shut up the kingdom of heaven,`" and will neither enter into it themselves,
nor suffer those that would enter, if they can hinder them;
and yet all the time they are seemingly inviting them to enter.

They strike full against the design of the gospel,
and maintain the impossibility of overcoming sin on this side of the grave:
though the destruction of sin is the very work of the gospel,
and this side of the grave the only scene of conquest over it.
They pamper up the proud, ambitious, and martial spirit of man; and,
in direct repugnancy to the very genius and spirit of the gospel,
blow up the people to wage war with their fellow creatures,
and imbrue their hands in the blood of mankind.

In short, there will never be much true gospel life, or preaching,
among men hired to preach;
and who undertake it with an expectation of procuring thereby an outward livelihood.
They run of themselves.
God does not send them; nor is it likely he will often qualify them,
or bless their labours to the people, otherwise than as He overrules events,
and brings good out of many other evils.
I do most seriously consider the standing orders of man-made
ministers as more pregnant with real injury,
and as being in itself, and in its train of consequences, a more serious evil,
an evil of greater magnitude to mankind, than any one evil beside, under the sun,
that I have any knowledge of.

I suppose some who think with me herein,
would scarcely like to have it so bluntly declared in public.
But I believe it _must,_ and will be declared.
God has determined the downfall of Babylon,
and He will have a few faithful testimony-bearers against her.
And though she may shift sides, change her dress, call herself the Lamb`'s wife,
cry out against Babylon, and affect to abhor her merchandise: yet,
through all her arts and evasions, she is seen,
and shall be seen by the single-eyed followers of the Lamb, the true leader,
who together make war with the beast, and will finally overcome him:
for the Lamb and His followers shall have the victory.

=== Our Strength Only in God

Our state in this life is a state of probation.
Such was the state of man originally, and such it is now.
In order to its being such, both then and now, there must have been, and now must be,
something to watch against, and wage war with.
And in order that man at first, or ever after, might be able to conquer in this war,
or be justly punishable for desertion or defeat, he was, is, and must be,
armed with armour invincible against all the powers
that were or are suffered to assail him.
This is just our ground, our state and situation.
Subject to vanity, or to many and various temptations;
yet being inwardly armed with the spirit of Omnipotence, so far as we stand faithful,
and fight valiantly in the strength afforded us, we are sure of victory.
Our strength or help is only in God; but then it is near us,
it is in us, it is no less than the very life and
power of God--nothing inferior to omnipotent aid;
a force superior to all possible opposition: a force that never was,
nor can be foiled in battle.
We are free to stand in this almighty and unconquerable ability,
and defeat the powers of darkness, or to turn from it, and be foiled and overcome.
When we stand, we know it is God alone upholds us: and when we fall,
we feel that our fall or destruction is of ourselves.

I am very clear in it, that at six and seven years of age, the _inward principle,_
(which is the hand and power of God, livingly operative upon the soul), so wrought,
and shone, and moved within me,
as to give me a sure and distinguishing sense of _right_ and _wrong,_ _good_ and _evil,_
in divers particulars; and in some things, altogether independent of human information.

I have nothing to boast of in regard to the penetrations of my own mind.
I am what I am; and it is the rejoicing of my Soul, that what I am,
I am by the _grace of God,_ in things of religious concernment, and not by human wisdom,
or scholastic attainment.

[.blurb]
=== God`'s Universal Love

If God`'s love is such to men, that He follows them by the strivings of His own Spirit,
and spares them, until by disobedience they become totally abandoned and corrupted,
before His Spirit ceases striving with them,
what greater evidence can we desire to have of the universality of His love,
the long-suffering of His patience, and impartial vouchsafement of His Holy Spirit,
not to a few, to the exclusion of the rest, but to all mankind the world over.
And what more than all reasoning confirms it to be so, is,
the absolute truth of the fact in the individual experience of all.
It is true many deny it.
The Jews also denied Christ to be the Son of God.
They did not know who, and what He was, and their insulting query,
"`Whom makest thou thyself?`"
was just as natural to proceed from them in their dark and carnal state,
as is the confidence wherewith thousands, high in profession of godliness,
now utterly disallow the Holy Spirit that is given to all, to be the Holy Spirit.
But this consolation have all wisdom`'s children, that "`wisdom is justified of them __all;__
and that the unbelief of others can never make void their faith: they are taught of God,
and great is their peace.`"

In regard to my own early acquaintance with the Holy Spirit`'s operation,
though I then knew not what it was,
I have __now__ no more doubt about it than I have about
the existence and omnipresence of God.
It is sealed upon my heart, with as much clearness and certainty,
that it is the Spirit of the living God, and that it visits, woos, invites,
and strives with all, at least for a season, as it is,
that God is no respecter of persons.
And I as fully believe no man can have any clear knowledge of God,
or of his own religious duty, without the Holy Spirit`'s influence,
as I believe the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God,
and that the world by wisdom knows Him not.

[.blurb]
=== Respect of Persons

In conversation this evening,
a person pled the suitableness and propriety of rich people`'s associating with rich,
and those of equal circumstances in the world with each other: alleging, that it was so,
for that with respect to religious circumstances;
for that those rich in faith and good works,
could not use the same freedom with those who are poor in faith, etc.,
as with each other.
I loved this person; but was grieved to hear such carnal arguments,
as these appeared to me to be.
That because truly religious persons are more nearly united,
and can use more freedom with each other,
than with irreligious or less religious persons,
that therefore rich people in the mammon of this world,
ought to associate together and use more freedom with each other,
than rich and poor though equally good.
This doctrine, or opinion,
strikes directly against the very intent and meaning of many affecting passages of Scripture.
For if this is not respecting of persons, I know not what is.
I would that all might have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ,
without respect of persons.
William Penn taught no such doctrines as the above.
His Reflections and maxims teach the reverse- "`not to think anyone, nor one`'s self,
the better or worse, for money, or the want of money.`"
I am sensible, that spirit which begets this love of great company,
is fruitful in furnishing arguments to justify it.
But let the arguments be drawn from the precepts and example of Jesus, our holy pattern,
and such arguments will deserve consideration.
Others, I think not to spend much time to refute.
But, however any may rest in such polluted conclusions,
I have known great travail of spirit and breathings to my great Master,
that I may be redeemed from such partiality.

O Lord my God! redeem my soul from every tincture of that love of greatness,
and great men`'s company, which invents such arguments;
and root out of my heart every seed of corruption,
that would lead me to love a rich man`'s company, better than a poor man`'s. For,
dear Lord, thou hast shown my exercised soul,
the baseness of such respect and partiality, and the deceitfulness of that spirit,
which prompts to and pleads for it.
Teach also, all thy chosen, O blessed Father! and purify all our hearts to do,
as well as to know Thy blessed will.

[.blurb]
=== Priestcraft and War

In our Preparative Meeting this month, among other things, some labour was bestowed,
to stir up Friends to a due consideration of the nature of paying taxes,
a considerable part of which is for the support of war; not only to pay soldiers,
but priests and chaplains, who,
under pretence of being ambassadors of the Prince of Peace,
do so grossly pervert the gospel of peace, as to preach up,
and animate poor inexperienced youth, to war and fighting.
They thereby poison people`'s souls, and are acting as the very bellows,
to blow up men`'s corrupt and revengeful passions, and kindle the flames of that fire,
the fierce burning of which is the Dragon`'s greatest glory, yea,
his highest triumph over the greatest mark of the disciples of Christ.
Indeed, it is his meat and drink,
to behold those who are professing to be Christ`'s disciples,
kill and devour one another.

For he knows that none are the disciples of Christ, but those __who love one another,__
and that _love_ one to another, is the greatest mark of being His disciples.
Consequently, when this roving,
devouring adversary can rule and reign in those who
profess to enlist under Christ`'s banner:
and when he can so far rob them of the mark of discipleship
as to make them (instead of fighting the good fight of faith,
and warring in the Lamb`'s warfare, against their own lusts) kill, distress,
and destroy one another;
then does he most abundantly rejoice and triumph and (as I said),
over the greatest and highest mark of true discipleship:
especially when he can engage the interest of the professed ministers of Christ,
the Prince of Peace, to forward his bloody designs, and prevent, as much as possible,
the spreading of the peaceable gospel and kingdom of Christ in the earth:
and to the utmost of his power, retard the fulfilment of those glorious prophecies,
delivered by God`'s ancient prophets,
respecting the time wherein swords shall be beaten into plowshares,
and spears into pruning- hooks; when nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
nor even so much as learn war any more.

It affects my heart to consider that Friends are paying taxes,
a great proportion of which is used to pay war-charges; and, among the rest,
to pay these perverters of the sweet and blessed gospel of purity and peace.
My very soul mourns over them, and on account of the mischief they are accessary to.
I believe I have seen them, in the light of life.
I believe it necessary that they should be exposed, and mankind better instructed.
I have no other end in writing as I do of them, but to open people`'s eyes,
and hasten the downfall of Antichrist, that mystery of iniquity,
that has got into the temple, and would be worshipped as God,
and exalted above all that is called God, and that ought of right, to be worshipped;
and also to hasten or promote the coming of the peaceable kingdom of the Lord on earth,
as it is in heaven.

[.blurb]
=== Reformation Goes on by Degrees

May the servants of the living God, of all denominations,
and may my beloved friends in an especial manner,
be preserved from affording any encouragement to the works of war and darkness,
priestcraft and delusion.
May they dig deep, feel the everlasting foundation, and come up nobly,
as far as truth may lead and open, in a faithful testimony against paying such taxes.
What though our worthy forefathers did pay them!
Did they not also hold slaves?
Must we do all they did?
Or, did they pretend to have perfected the reformation?
Did they not, on the other hand, manifest great doubts respecting this very matter?
Read John Richardson`'s Journal, where it is shown that the payment of such taxes,
was borne with, rather than approved.

"`Follow no man, further than he follows Christ,`" is both a safe, and a just maxim.
And as true it is, that reformation may be retarded,
by looking at the example of those esteemed good people, either living or departed.
Those who are gone might have done all they were required to do in their day,
and might not have come to the sight of some things
that may be obligatory upon us at this day.
The work of reformation goes on by degrees,
and the diligence of _past ages_ has by no means perfected the work,
I am so as to leave nothing for this to move in.
I am persuaded, whether I live to see it or not, a day will come,
when God will raise up a people, who, by faithfulness to His light,
will be enabled in His power, to refuse the payment of such taxes.
And blessed be his Name, He has raised up several such in this age;
may they not be discouraged.
This testimony shall be yet glorious,
and will be seen and owned to have arisen from the pure enlightenings of truth.

[.blurb]
=== The Law and the Prophets.

In one of our meetings, it opened upon my mind, that people in the first nature,
before a change of heart is wrought,
were in that state wherein the old law became necessary; and that in this state,
their passions being unsubdued, and their resentments keen and furious,
they were ready to invoke the Almighty, to avenge them on their outward adversaries,
and to subdue their enemies before them: this being no further an advance in reformation,
at most, than the dispensation of the law.
But as people are faithful to the leadings of truth,
under the several dispensations of the Almighty,
their passions become more and more subjected, their resentments more and more bounded,
and their wills more resigned,
and they at length arrive to the dispensation of the prophets, that is, to the prophetic,
or foreseeing dispensation:
under which they have stronger impressions and clearer
views of the coming of a further dispensation still;
and of the necessity of their own wills being still more given up and resigned;
being impressed with a foresight and belief that it is not only necessary,
but attainable, through faithfulness, even so far as to know and feel,
that vengeance is the Lord`'s, and that He will repay:
and that man must cease from exercising revenge, and leave his cause with the Lord.
Under this foreseeing dispensation, many, I believe, have been made sensible,
that a time would come, wherein themselves, as individuals,
would be restrained from learning war,
or lifting up sword against outward enemies any more.

All this I believe, may be witnessed under the dispensation of the prophets,
or of prophecy or foresight, which is a further advance than that of the mere law,
wherein the wrathful passions may for a season prevail,
and yet does not come to the complete bringing in of the Messiah,
or the gospel dispensation.
For I clearly saw, beyond all doubt, that whoever
comes to know the peaceable Messiah`'s dispensation
brought in and completely established in his soul,
will certainly breathe forth in life, conversation, and conduct,
"`Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.`"
This was the song of the angels at the very birth of Christ, the Prince of Peace,
and must and will be the song or language of those
in whose hearts He is allowed to rule and reign,
exercising in full dominion the power by which He is the exalted Son of God; which,
in plain words, is the _power of love._

[.blurb]
=== The Gospel Dispensation

When this comes to be the case, with any soul,
that soul is "`passed from death to life,`" and is not under the law, but under grace.
Yea, when this gospel dispensation is established in the soul,
it is neither under the law, nor under the prophetic or foreseeing dispensation,
which is a state of expecting and waiting for; but this is a state of witnessing,
and experiencing the beating of swords into plowshares, and learning war no more.
How different is the prayer of the soul under this
dispensation from the prayer of the fighter,
at best but under the law.
The gospel prayer is not, "`O Lord, avenge us on our outward adversaries,
and subdue our outward enemies,`" but "`Forgive us our trespasses
as __we forgive__ those that trespass against us.`"
Observe well, the very foundation of asking forgiveness is, __as we forgive.__
This is the gospel prayer.
This is the prayer that Jesus taught.
And yet many have the presumption to call themselves His ministers,
and even to use these words in prayer,
while at the same time they are wishing God to help
them to overcome and __destroy__ their fellow men.
Oh! horrid presumption!
Will they presume to approach the Lord Almighty with invocation
to Him to destroy those that __trespass against them,__
and yet not blush at their own hypocrisy and formality when they talk about and cry out,
"`Forgive us as we forgive those that trespass against us.`"

Hear, O ye heavens! and be astonished,
O earth at the confusion and inconsistency of those who
yet profess to be the followers of the Prince of Peace;
even of Him who not only taught us to pray to be forgiven __as we forgive,__ saying,
"`If ye forgive men their trespasses,
your heavenly Father will also for- give you;`" and
telling Peter to forgive "`not only till seven times,
but until seventy times seven.`"
I say He not only taught this doctrine, but exemplified it,
particularly in this remarkable language or prayer for His crucifiers: "`Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they do,`"
which He set his followers to imitate:
and which that pious martyr Stephen so fully imitated, that when he was stoned,
being filled with the Holy Spirit, he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice, "`Lord,
lay not this sin to their charge.`"

This was ancient Christianity!
O glorious day!
O blessed Christians!
But, alas! now men would pass for Christians,
who are living in the spirit of revenge and war.
Oh! when will their eyes be eyes be opened to see their inconsistency,
and their hearts changed from wrath to love!

[.blurb]
=== Neglecting the Lord`'s Visitations

In the 10th month, being in town, I saw a person confined to a sick bed,
who appeared to be in great distress of mind.
He confessed that he had been tenderly visited in order for his reformation, but said he,
"`I did not keep close to it.`"
He manifested much concern that others might be warned of their danger,
and excited to look about themselves and see where they stand; saying,
in some agony of mind, "`If I had kept up in all things, O Lord, how blessed, how happy,
should I now be!`"

Oh! that all people, particularly the youth, may be awakened by such awful examples,
and preserved from the like evils.
For whatever they may think in times of health and prosperity,
and however they may lull their consciences to sleep,
a time will come when the judgments of the Lord will
assuredly bring those into a state of anguish,
condemnation, and distress, who practise wicked works.
Think, dear youth, timely think, how much better, how much more comfortable it will be,
on a sick or dying bed, to have lived righteously,
and to have your hearts filled with joy unspeakable,
and your mouths with songs of consolation and praises,
than to live wickedly and on a dying pillow to have,
in deep anguish and keen condemnation, to cry out as this poor man did,
"`O Lord! what shall I do?
what shall I do?
Oh! the poor sinners!
Oh! the distressed souls!`"
And at the same time to be obliged to own yourselves of that number;
and in deep lamentation to reflect how disobedient you have been,
and how blessed and happy you might have been, had you been faithful.
Oh! that all young people would take warning, would keep near the Light,
and learn early to number their days, and apply their hearts unto wisdom,
that so their latter end may be peace,
and their future state in another world joy unspeakable and full of glory.

[.blurb]
=== Silent Waiting

+++[+++1778]
For a considerable length of time,
I had believed it best for me to write how every day was spent.
This was useful to me, by bringing me to a kind of daily reckoning.
But as what has once been a useful practice may be too long persisted in,
and thus become a mere formality, I felt easy to omit, at least for a season,
the continuation of so particular an account.
The practice of silent waiting, has afforded solid satisfaction to my mind.
I have felt the precious effects of such seasons, for years past; and often,
when I have neglected it,
I have had sorrowfully to repent of something or other that
has happened by reason of my mind being off its watch.
Oh! that I may henceforward be favoured not only with frequency of such opportunities,
but with a heart sensible of the blessing that attends them.

Blessed be the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
that he has been pleased to teach my soul how and where to wait upon Him,
and enjoy His holy presence while multitudes in this
benighted world are groping in darkness,
being directed by their hireling teachers to look _without,_
for what they must find _within._
Thus they are seeking the living among the dead.
Oh! that the eyes of all may be opened,
and their hearts rightly impressed with a sense that the
inward reproofs of instruction are the way of Life,
and that, to wait upon the Lord, is the way to renew a Christian`'s strength.

[.blurb]
=== A Prayer

O Lord my God! preserve me.
Preserve me, dearest Father,
from reproaching Thy Name and from burdening Thy heritage with unsanctified offerings,
the untimely fruits of a spirit of forwardness,
the vain productions of a superficial mind, or the rash exertions of an infatuated zeal.
But, O blessed Lord! may Thy holy Name ever be kept sacred,
and Thy ministers enabled to rise up in Thy awful dread and holy authority,
having on the Urim and the Thummim, and being adorned with the girdle of truth,
the "`bell and the pomegranate`": that so, the glory, honour,
and renown may be feelingly and reverently ascribed unto Thee, forevermore.
Amen, amen, saith my soul.

[.blurb]
=== A Chosen People Beheld in Vision

At our Yearly Meeting this year, 1779, the subject of Friends paying taxes for war,
came under solid consideration.
Friends were unanimous, that the testimony of truth, and of our society,
was clearly against our paying such taxes as were wholly for war;
and many solid Friends manifested a lively testimony
against the payment of those in the mixture;
which testimony appeared evidently to me to be on substantial ground,
arising and spreading in the authority of truth.
It was a time of refreshment to an exercised number, whose spirits, I trust,
were feelingly relieved, in a joyful sense of the light which then sprung up among us.
On the whole, I am renewedly confirmed,
that however the burden-bearers of the present generation among us may hold on their way,
or fall short and give back, the Lord will raise up a band of faithful followers, who,
preferring Jerusalem`'s welfare to their chiefest joys,
will press through the crowd of reasonings,
and follow the Lamb whithersoever He leadeth them.
They shall be supported by the power of an endless life,
that shall be quickened and maintained in them.
The heat and drought by day, shall not defeat them:
nor shall they be dismayed at the frost and cold by night.
Salvation shall the Lord appoint for walls and bulwarks round about them.
Omnipotence shall be their shield; their lamp, the light of Jesus.
They shall set sufferings and dangers at defiance, and disregard persecution;
yet meekness and gentleness shall adorn them.
False zeal and rashness they shall carefully shun.
Though bold as lions in the Lamb`'s cause and combat, they shall be kind, loving,
and not causelessly severe or provoking.

This is the people mine eyes have seen in prospect.
In vision I have beheld this chosen heritage of God.
As the apple of His eye He will keep them, and watch over them,
and water them as a garden enclosed.

[.blurb]
=== Afflictions

O afflicted soul, whoever thou art?
for unless thou endure the chastening of the Lord, thou art a bastard and not a son.
By His fatherly chastisements,
He brings into the obedience and filial attachment of sons,
He enables to sing of mercy and of judgment,
and confirms His children in a steadfast reliance upon Himself,
through every storm and tempest.
Oh! bless His holy Name forever, exalt and praise Him,
even for the turning of His hand in probation- for the exercise of His rod in chastisement.
It is all for good, and will surely work good to all who rightly abide the trial.
Indeed, every trial ought to be received with thankfulness,
as intended and working for our good.
And seeing afflictions are oft the most substantial blessings to a true Christian traveller,
let us in true resignation of heart, under each painful stroke,
ascribe goodness to our God, and, in the pathetic language of Young,
render Him the tribute of thanksgiving, and say, __"`For all__ I bless Thee,
most for the __severe.`"__

[.blurb]
=== Dangerous Desire for Wealth

+++[+++1781]
31st of 3rd month.
I have for years felt strong desires to be wholly
redeemed from the improper pursuit of worldly enjoyments,
and even from all desires of wealth beyond what my
heavenly Father knoweth I have need of;
as also from all use of things,
the procuring of which would require more of my time
than would be consistent with my religious duty;
or which would cause me, or any under me, to labour beyond the true medium,
or beyond the degree which best promotes health of body and tranquillity of mind.
I have mourned to see the true standard so lamentably departed from in these respects,
among all societies of professing Christians.
Multitudes are miserably toiling and drudging, from day to day, and from year to year,
scarce allowing themselves time to assemble for divine worship,
nor scarce time to rest and refresh their bodies.
And many, when they do get to their religious meetings,
are too often so exhausted by immoderate fatigue,
that they are fitter for sleep than divine worship.
I am fully satisfied if men would keep to that holy principle which bounds the desires,
and gives content in a moderate way of living,
they would enjoy more solid peace and living,
and happiness than is often experienced in the apartments of affluence,
or in the walks of magnificence.
What is all the glitter and show of high life in comparison of,

[.offset.centered]
__"`What nothing earthly gives, nor can destroy, The soul`'s calm sunshine,
and the heartfelt joy.
True virtue`'s prize.`"__

Thousands are anxiously aiming to keep up an appearance, which, though far behind many,
is yet above their real ability to support without injury to their circumstances; indeed,
a little straining beyond our circumstances may embarrass us through life,
keep us upon the toil, and discompose our minds, or at least absorb our attention,
so as to embitter our lives, or prevent that true quiet,
wherein we might dwell so inward and resigned as to _acquaint ourselves with God,
and be at peace._

Moreover, it is too commonly the case, that even religious people, that is,
such as have been really so for a season,
when they give way to this dangerous desire of wealth,
or of living too much as they see others live, gradually lose ground, until,
in their planning and contriving, they get more or less in a way of over-reaching,
or at least of crowding too hard upon those they deal with,
bearing them down in their prices,
or in some degree extorting too great a price for things sold them.

There are many ways to oppress a little, take small advantages,
and exercise some degree of extortion.
And when the mind becomes habituated and gradually reconciled to a less degree,
the way is too often paved to a greater degree,
until many things will go down pretty easily which would have set
very uneasy upon the mind in days of greater tenderness,
and more conscientious exactness and holy fear.

I doubt not, many have seen and deplored these things in their early progress,
thought they would not for all earth`'s glory, be overtaken in them, and yet,
letting out their desires after more than is meet for them,
have slid gradually into the same error.
I have seen the progress of this spirit with sorrow,
and mourned over some who have been grievously entangled and ensnared in it.

O, thou traveller Zionward! flee, flee for thy life, from all these allurements;
take God for thy portion, and his Holy Spirit for thy law and limitation.
Be content with what is convenient for thee;
there is more true joy therein than in all the accumulations of avarice.
I believe it will be good for me, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus,
often to examine impartiality, Do I exercise no degrees of extortion?
Am I redeemed from the love and friendship of the world?
Do I not give way to desires of living above what Truth or my circumstances allow of?
Am I not in the use of some things which are not necessary?
If thou hast this belief, see to it, and endeavour to deny thyself,
and be satisfied with such things, and supplies of them,
as thy heavenly Father knoweth thou hast need of.

[.blurb]
=== The Future Victory of Truth

Not long after this, as I lay down to sleep, one night, about common bed time,
soon after closing my eyes,
it seemed as if I intelligibly heard the voice of a gospel minister, whose words,
though an entire stranger, seemed very familiar to me.
He seemed to stand in a very erect and fixed posture,
and with awfulness and authority uttered these words:
"`The Lord of hosts is about to extend, and exalt the testimony of Truth on earth:
and He will exalt it more and more;
although many among Friends have opposed its uniform arising in this land.`"
This language aroused me as from a state of slumber;
and soon after I was again in a state, wherein I heard, or seemed to hear,
the same voice, which distinctly said, "`The truth shall gain the victory.
It has gained a victory in time past; but the victory which it shall gain,
shall be greater than the victory which it hath already gained.`"

=== Obey Government

+++[+++1781]
At our Yearly Meeting, the testimony so far prevailed, that it was agreed and advised,
that Friends of each Monthly Meeting should collect and send up
accounts of the sufferings of such as could not for conscience-sake,
pay taxes, a part whereof was for the purpose of war and fighting.
Particular care was to be taken that these accounts should stand clear,
as a testimony against war, without regard to this or that Government or Administration.
For it was the desire of Friends, at the same time, to support both testimonies;
that against war, and that of submission to government;
and not to admit of accounts of sufferings arising from scruples about the new government,
if any such should arise.
Seeing it is our testimony, and we believe truth leads to it,
to obey actively or passively every government set over us; _actively,_
where the things required of us affect not the jurisdiction of conscience; and _passively,_
or by suffering, where the requisition invades that jurisdiction.

[.blurb]
=== Imaginary wants

At our Quarterly Meeting, in the 7th month,
a committee was appointed to visit the several Monthly Meetings, and labour,
as ability might be given, for reformation.
Some endeavours were used to dissuade Friends from that use of things,
and from the use of such things, which promote not the true harmony of mankind,
nor do any essential good to those who use them.
This ought to be a serious consideration with all Christians.
"`They that are Christ`'s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.`"
What then have they to do with care, toil, and anxiety, to procure things needless;
with pride, vanity, and indulgence, in the use of them?
All the use of this world`'s goods,
is but to provide for our outward comfort through this passage of life:
and yet how many make themselves slaves,
or at least greatly lessen or prevent their own comfort in life,
by giving way to the influence of improper desires and imaginary wants.

[.blurb]
=== Self Importance and a Counterfeit

At the Quarterly Meeting in the 10th month I was bowed under a
sense of my own utter insufficiency to do anything usefully,
without the aid of the Holy Spirit.
I retired to the gift in myself, waited its immediate operation, and therein,
toward the close of the meeting, was enabled so to discharge my duty,
in relation to the exercises I was under,
as to obtain substantial relief and solid satisfaction.

May we all be wholly redeemed from all thoughts of self-importance,
and creaturely sufficiency.
There is scarcely anything,
which more eminently disqualifies for service in the church
or obstructs the Current of life in our meetings;
and there is very great danger of getting into a way of acting in religious matters,
without a living sense of the holy anointing and qualifying oil.
Too many take the warmth and flashes of their own inward spirits,
for divine impulse and inspiration.
Indeed, some have gone great lengths into rank enthusiasm, and even ranterism,
at different times in the world, under mistaken apprehensions of divine motions.

I am as well settled in a firm belief of the reality of divine inspiration,
and that it is as truly the privilege of Christians now,
as ever it was of any in any age of the world, as I am of any doctrine of the gospel.
It is no new thing for pretenders to assume it,
who are sadly beguiled by the workings of a warm and wild imagination.
A counterfeit is rather an evidence of a reality, than a solid argument against it.
And though one, in the days of the apostles, might, unauthorised,
set up for "`the great power of God,`" or give out "`that himself was some great
one,`" it could not prevent the evident operations and displays of divine power,
in and by the apostles.
And as Christ was, according to His promise, with His people in that day,
by the blessed influences and inspirations of His Holy Spirit,
so He most assuredly will be with them "`to the end of the world.`"
Let all be careful to wait for His inward and spiritual coming;
and by no means take up with a counterfeit appearance in His absence,
lest the sad mistake be too late discovered,
and loss and disappointment be the dreadful consequence of the awful deception.

[.blurb]
=== Perfect Freedom from Sin

Oh! that I may be preserved pressing forward with full purpose
of heart towards a state of perfect freedom from sin.
I know well that no one sin can be mortified and overcome, but through Divine assistance;
but as certainly as the power of God upon us can, or ever does,
enable us to overcome _any one evil:_
so certainly it is able to assist us to the complete overcoming of _all;_
and we may rely upon it, He will redeem us from all iniquity,
unless the stubbornness of our wills prevent.
If Jerusalem`'s children had given up their own _wills,_ Christ would have gathered them.
According to His own testimony _he would,_ but _they would not._

=== Quietness as a canopy covers my mind.

[verse]
____
Great God, Thy Name be blest!
Thy goodness be ador`'d!
My soul has been distress`'d,
But Thou hast peace restor`'d.

A thankful heart I feel,
In peace my mind is stayed,
Balsamic ointments heal,
The wounds by sorrow made.

Though elements contend,
Though wind and waters rage,
I`'ve an unshaken Friend,
Who doth my grief assuage.

Though storms without arise,
Emblems of those within,
On Christ my soul relies,
The sacrifice for sin.

Though inward storms prevail,
Afflicting to endure,
I`'ve help that cannot fail,
In Him that`'s ever sure.

Though outward war and strife,
Prevail from sea to sea,
I`'ve peace in inward life,
And that`'s enough for me.

Though clamour rear its head,
And stalk from shore to shore,
My food is angels`' bread,
What can I covet more?

Though ill reports abound,
Suspicions and surmise,
I find, and oft have found,
In death true comfort lies:

That death I mean, whereby
Self-love and will are slain;
For these the more they die,
The more the Lamb doth reign.

And well assured I am,
True peace is only known,
Where He, the harmless Lamb,
Has made the heart His throne.

Then, then may tempests rage,
Cannon may roar in vain
The rock of every age,
The Lamb, the Lamb doth reign.

[.blurb]
=== The Love of Money

I feel breathings of soul to be set at liberty from the bondage of earthly cares,
that they may have no more share of my attention than duty requires.
I have seen, with heartfelt pain, the ravages of a worldly spirit;
I have mourned the desolations which the love of gain has
made among many who once in degree renounced it.

Oh! the love of money!
What destruction it has made of religious engagements!
What desolation it has spread over the minds of many,
whose state once resembled a well watered garden!
How mournfully true the expressions of the poet:

[verse]
____
By it, at fifty, oft have been undone,
The virtues of a saint at twenty-one.
____

What coldness! what numbness, insensibility, and slackness of true religious engagement,
have gradually come over too many once serious, seeking, humble souls!
Methinks that ancient alarm might again be properly sounded throughout the camp of Israel,
"`O earth! earth! earth! hear the word of the Lord!`"
But who, alas! shall sound it?
Or, by whom shall Jacob arise, for truly the wrestling seed is small?
Shall any among the sons of men be able to sound the necessary alarm?
Or, are all gone astray, from the priest (who engaged, at first,
for gold) to the prophet, (one truly sent of the Lord, and weaned from the love of gain)?
Has covetousness, which is idolatry, drawn many from their steadfastness,
and even benumbed the Lord`'s anointed?

O Lord God Almighty!
I pray thee arise for our help; for except Thou, O holy Helper, help,
there is no help for us:
the people whom Thou hast called out of Egyptian darkness will yet perish in the wilderness,
and never enter into possession of the promised land, unless Thou, O most merciful,
again make bare Thy holy arm for our awakening and furtherance in the way of Life.

[.blurb]
=== Family Worship in Silence

I have been renewedly confirmed in the great advantage to families,
and even to small children, that results from sitting down in solemn silence,
and therein waiting upon God.
I have seen the children much broken and tendered in such seasons, so that,
even when there has not been a word spoken, the tears have rolled down their cheeks,
and their looks have been evidently expressive of heartfelt sensations.
This practice also learns them silence and subjection; it curbs their wills,
and habituates them to restraint,
and a patient waiting for their parents`' permission to engage in their little diversions.
The habits of silence, subjection, and patient waiting for permission,
are very useful to children from infancy to mature age,
and many suffer much for want of it.

I have also seen much advantage to children, and indeed to whole families,
from the practice of a solemn pause at meals: it learns children stillness, decency,
and reverence: and, where it is done in feeling manner,
with minds rightly turned to feel after God and experience His blessing,
and is not practised in a slight formal manner,
it tends to season and solemnize the minds of young and old.
I have seen it done in a very careless, lifeless manner, with scarce any reverence:
divers of the family conversing not far from the table,
and scarce any sense of the divine presence prevalent in the minds of those around it;
and perhaps the pause scarce long enough to allow of much solid sensibility or reverential
acknowledgment of the favours received from the bounty of a gracious God,
in the ample provisions of His providential care for our bodies,
or His continued extension of fatherly regard to our immortal souls.
I think such an undevout appearance can be very little to the divine acceptance;
but where a proper pause is observed, and the Lord is therein seriously sought to,
the mind being feelingly impressed with a sense of His aid and assistance,
and all branches of the family are reverently silent,
it is an oblation well-pleasing in the sight of God, and very useful to such families.

I am morally certain,
that I have many a day gone through the cares and concerns of life with much more composure,
stability, satisfaction, and propriety,
for the strength and assistance I have found in drawing
near to God in solemn silence in my family;
and I wish the practice of reverently adoring Him in this way may increase more and more.
I am, beyond all doubt, assured, it is a practice abundantly more acceptable to God,
and useful to men, than that of set, vocal prayers.
I believe that, very generally, those prayers are dry, flat, and formal.
Indeed, they ever will be so, while men will rush into them,
without waiting for divine qualification.
They may indeed think they have done something;
and the better they are satisfied with prayers of their own preparation or conceiving,
the greater their danger:
for it puts them the further from seeking to God for the help of his Holy Spirit.
But they who wait on Him reverently, and hungeringly desire and feel after His holy help,
though they may not at all times find it their business to utter a word vocally,
do yet truly ask it, and comfortably receive it.
Wait on the Lord, O my soul! and oftener than the morning draw near unto Him,
and feel after Him.

[.blurb]
=== Unsanctified Ministry

6th month, 9th. My mind has been much exercised on account of an unsanctified ministry,
that appears too much, even among some in our society.
When once people give way to this forward spirit,
they grow confident and are apt to spurn at, or neglect, wholesome admonition.
I have mourned over some who seemed to me, like the prophets of Baal,
the idolaters of old.
"`They set up their idols under every green tree.`"
I have thought they could scarcely forbear proceeding to an offering,
in almost every little flash that they felt; and even endeavouring to stir up,
and warm themselves and others, by the sparks of their own kindling.
But the end of all this must be, to "`lie down in sorrow.`"

[.blurb]
=== A Narrow Censorious Spirit

At Acoakset, we found some members overrun with a false and fiery zeal:
giving way to a narrow, censorious spirit; judging and condemning their brethren,
even those deeper in true religious experience than themselves,
because they were not so strenuous and exact in some little outside things as they were:
and in regard to real faults, magnifying molehills into mountains,
instead of exercising that living and divine charity that covers the multitude of sins.
I was grieved in perceiving the blindness of this false and fiery zeal prevailing.
I saw its narrowing influence on the minds of its deluded votaries,
and its oppressive bearing on some who saw beyond it.
I believe it will never be best to lay so much stress on these outward things,
however individuals may be rightly led into them,
as to censure or lightly esteem those who do not feel their minds exercised in them.
I cannot conceive any real advantage in exact uniformity, in all outward appearances,
and ways of living and acting.
There are certain important things,
concerning which I believe an outward rule of society, requiring conformity,
is actually necessary and useful; but it is clear to my mind, many lesser matters,
wherein a diversity of action and appearance, may be much better than rigid uniformity.

The life of religion is an internal thing; and,
though doubtless affected by an outward conduct, I think men are,
and in every age will be, liable to get too much outward in their views,
and lay too much stress on exteriors.
How has water-baptism, bread and wine, etc., diverted thousands from the solid substance!
All exterior things in a religious life may be overrated, and relied upon,
till they become as the brazen serpent, _Nehushtan, a mere piece of brass._
And I think, if one exact, uniform appearance in all things,
ever takes place in our Society, and is thought necessary and insisted on,
it will be when the form has eaten out the substance; or when, for want of a real,
living growth in the inward life, the form becomes the main object,
instead of the substance.
Yet I am a hearty well-wisher to plainness;
I grieve to see the sorrowful departure from it into pride and superfluity.
I never saw an instance of any very considerable departure of this kind,
but I had reason to be convinced that a real loss was sustained by the individuals,
or their best advancement prevented.
But I have suffered much deep distress of soul under
a painful and depressing sense of that contracted,
illiberal, and harsh spirit, which in some instances has the ascendancy,
leading into extremes without the life.
I know the Truth leads into great regularity and circumspection of life;
and I abhor that light chaffy spirit that makes ridicule of it,
and lightly esteems the exemplary appearance and true religious zeal of the faithful.

I doubt not many libertine minds may lay hold of such remarks as the above
to justify their own deviations from the plain path of truth,
the narrow way that leads to Life;
and think thereby to screen themselves from the just judgment of truth through the brethren;
but this will not avail them; the way remains, as ever of old, a narrow way,
a way of self-denial, and the daily cross.

But, O unhappy and deluded people! whoever they are, that in their zeal for externals,
lose charity.
They depart from the Life and lay hold on formality for all outward
things in religion dwindle unavoidably into formality,
in proportion as charity is departed from,
and zeal takes place in things pertaining to the outside of the cup and platter,
without a living sense of the inward spring of Life,
which can never be experienced without living, fervent charity.
I wish the living may ever vigilantly and zealously exert themselves in truth`'s authority,
to suppress superfluity, and every species of pride, ostentation, and vanity.

But I believe it will ever be best that so much variety in some things should continue,
as to help weak minds, in some degree, to a discovery,
that the life does not consist so much, or so essentially, in these outward things,
as many might otherwise be induced to suppose.
Therefore, let us ever keep steadily to our plain way of living, in the life of Truth:
for I am assured, so far as it is rightly kept to, Truth owns and supports it;
and its influence on the mind is very beneficial.
But Oh! that we may ever be preserved from a narrow, rash, censorious spirit;
and from overrating any outward regularity or exact living: lest, as we grow in the form,
we dwindle as to the Life.
Although these remarks may not have a very extensive influence in rightly guarding others;
yet I must write what I have to write, and leave it,
hoping Divine Providence will yet build up Zion and fortify Jerusalem,
directing the course of the sincere-hearted between all the extremes,
the sure and safe path of virtue, where a lively,
active zeal is tempered with liberality of heart and sentiment,
in the flowings of true charity.

[.blurb]
=== Hardness

We laboured in the Monthly Meetings as ability was afforded,
and I trust to some solid satisfaction.
Dartmouth Monthly Meeting we found in the contrary extreme,
though lying contiguous to Acoakset.
It is a large meeting, much departed from plainness,
and very little in the exercise of a living engagement for good order or reformation,
either in regard to inward righteousness, or outward conduct and Conversation.
We had very hard work among them, but it seemed to very little good purpose.
What was said to them appeared to make no more impression on some,
than water spilt on a rock, which immediately runs off again,
And from others it rebounded back,
like an elastic ball thrown against an impenetrable substance.
I am satisfied plain, close dealing is much wanting and must be used in many places.
And though it cannot be expected all will think well of it, or rightly receive it,
yet as the labourers keep to truth`'s anointing, they will be carried through,
and receive the reward of their faithfulness.

[.blurb]
=== Nantucket

Nantucket is a pretty orderly Monthly Meeting.
They exhibit outward plainness, and generally, to appearance,
walk in good degree circumspectly.
They have had a good deal of true gospel-preaching:
the servants having been frequently sent among them.
They love to hear it; and yet, it appears me,
many of them are far more in form than substance.
They are too little in the true medium, wherein a living,
vigorous concern for a deep in-dwelling of the divine life,
and therein maintaining a strict discipline and good order,
is united with a lively flow of extensive charity, and true Christian liberality.
Many of them, I fear, esteem themselves as Abraham`'s children,
and have scarce any true sense that they were ever, or now are in bondage.
And though a few are alive in the holy Root,
yet too many are too well satisfied with outward regularity
and too much unacquainted with the substance of true religion.
Real renovation and regeneration are too much wanting among them.
They were warned of their danger,
and called to a deep consideration of the necessity of a
more living experience of the essentials of religion.

Before we left the island, we were relieved in mind,
having endeavoured to show Friends the insufficiency and unsuitableness of husks,
(an outside thing), for food for man: and the necessity of gathering manna,
fresh every day; for, whatever was gathered, even by themselves, in times past,
will not sustain the soul today;
much less what was gathered by their ancestors before they were born.
I fear too many striving to live on such old gatherings; and if so,
it will surely breed worms, as in the camp of Israel in ancient days.
I hope a little remnant of living wrestlers will wrestle till the break of day,
and so obtain the blessing.
May these be preserved, and their number increase.

[.blurb]
=== Too Much Preaching

I fear we have too much preaching in the Quarterly Meeting.
It is a very different thing to get down, and preach to the spirits in prison,
than it is to move the passions.
There is a vast difference between the genuine fire of the Holy Ghost,
and all the false likenesses thereof, kindled by the warmth of man`'s spirit; or,
as it were, brought from heaven by the false prophet, in the sight,
and under the influence of the beast.
Oh! that all who attempt to be mouth for the Highest, may dwell deep,
and know a thorough ceasing from, and dying to all mere _self-activity,_
and wait in the silence of all flesh, till He comes to rule and reign whose right it is,
and whose _words are spirit and life._

And O my own soul! learn thou this sacred lesson;
and presume not to speak in the Name of the Lord, without the word of His command.
Ever wait His opening, and His assistance, to give utterance.
Then, and not till then, will thy offerings be pleasant, and acceptable to the Lord,
and substantially profitable to the people.

[.blurb]
=== Continued Unfaithfulness

In Sandwich Monthly Meeting my mind was impressed with a sense
of a state of long continued unfaithfulness in some present,
even from youth to old age.
Notwithstanding many renewed visitations of divine good,
great insensibility had come upon them; so that I even feared,
(and had to express it,) that the day of grace was almost expired with some,
unless they were soon prevailed on to repent.
In the openings of life they were reminded of the precious
visitations heretofore extended for their gathering;
and that God`'s spirit would not always strive with man:
that the midnight cry must ere long be heard, "`Behold the bridegroom cometh,
go ye out to meet him;`" and that at that awful period, the lamp of profession,
without the oil, would not profitably avail them.
But that "`when once the good man of the house hath risen up, and shut the door,`"
it will be in vain to stand without, knocking for an entrance and saying, "`Lord, Lord,
open unto us.`"
For that awful sentence must go forth against all
the finally impenitent, "`Depart from me,
ye workers of iniquity, I know you not.`"

May the ministers in our society ever remember, that of themselves, without Christ,
they can do nothing.
May they remember and maintain the testimony of truth,
against that cloud of lifeless ministry, which abounds in the nations, and is,
indeed (without breach of charity), "`a common eclipse
between God and the souls of the people.`"

[.blurb]
=== Activity in Discipline

I got home to my dear wife and family, the 8th of the 7th month, and,
finding them tolerably well, I left home next day, to attend our own Quarterly Meeting.
Here I was rather too active in discipline.
I have found it my business, sometimes of late, to be more inward in travail,
and less active in the exercise of the wholesome rules of society, than I once was;
and believe, when I have obeyed the call into this inward, still abode,
and there felt my loins rightly girded,
it has contributed much more to the right exercise of the discipline, than when,
through a desire for its proper administration, I have, by over-acting,
seemed to do a good deal for its execution.

[.blurb]
=== Backsliding

+++[+++1783]
In the 9th month, in company with my dear friend Jaazaniah Barrett,
I visited Friends`' families at Richmond, New Hampshire,
a distant branch of our Monthly Meeting;
we were also at their meeting there on First-day.
We were silent in nearly all the families, and the First-day meeting was very painful.
"`The Lord has covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in His anger,`" in this place,
because of backsliding, unfaithfulness, and earthly-mindedness.
"`Oh! that mine head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears,
that I might weep day and night, for the slain of the daughter of my people.`"
The children are ready to fly away, and the parents, sunk into the earth,
seem very much unconcerned about them.
Alas! what will they answer in the day when inquisition for blood shall be made?
when inquiry shall be made for the lambs committed to their care in the wilderness,
the wilderness of this wicked, tempting, and prevalently alluring world?

I thought much of the mountains of Gilboa; for it seems to me, that at Richmond,
there is scarcely a drop of dew, or rain,
and very little of anything in the nature of true fields of offerings.
For there indeed, "`the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away.
How are the weapons of war perished!`"
Ye daughters of Israel, weep over the desolations of Zion!
I believe we viewed the mansions of the dead, in some of our silent,
painful sittings among Friends in this place.
At several of our meetings at Uxbridge, not long after this,
I had livingly to sound an alarm among Friends; calling on them to awake,
and arise from that awful lethargy, that has prevailed over too many,
whose earlier days were days of divine favour and living exercise.
These days they were reminded of, and also of a day of revival,
which divers deceased Friends, such as Samuel Fothergill, John Churchman, and others,
have expressed a living foresight of.
Oh! that we of the present age, may so draw near to the fountain of life,
as to witness something of this blessed revival.

Previous to these late meetings, I had not, since my removal to Uxbridge,
risen enough in my mind,
the lifeless babblings that too much abound here under the pretence of divine qualification,
to utter any thing in any of our public meetings; but now,
being lifted up in the pure power of eternal truth,
above all the depressions occasioned by lifeless,
chaffy kind of communication,
my soul humbly rejoiced in the relief I obtained in these few favoured meetings.

[.blurb]
=== Select Conferences

A number of well-concerned Friends of this Monthly Meeting,
from a desire of good to themselves and to promote the good of society,
having for some time a desire to meet together, at seasons,
solidly to confer together upon such subjects as might appear profitable, did,
some time past, make a beginning.
We have met divers times, and have been, at several of these seasons,
baptized into death, or such creaturely abasement, as not to be able,
for a considerable length of time, to move forward upon any subject.
But as we have lain low, and been willing to be with Christ, in His depression,
His agony, His death, and His burial,
we have been livingly raised with Him in His resurrection, into newness of divine life,
and have sensibly known Him to be "`the resurrection and the life,`" to,
and in our own souls.
Then have we gone forward rejoicing, He going before us.
Divers important matters have been the subjects of these four religious conferences.
We have had much solid satisfaction in them, and a belief has been sealed on our minds,
that such opportunities are very profitable,
and might be highly promotive of the welfare of society,
if rightly encouraged and attended, in the several Monthly Meetings; and,
perhaps in some places, members from several Monthly Meetings,
might usefully attend such conferences.

[.blurb]
=== Divine Things Hid from the Wise

Under the exercises, conflicts, and deep inward trials,
which I had to experience through this year, it has gradually, from time to time,
been opened and sealed on my mind, that a great part of the Scriptures,
which many generally understand to speak only to outward things,
is either only a metaphorical or allegorical relation and description of things inward,
expressed by outward images or representations,
or that the real outward acts and occurrences may be understood,
by the truly enlightened mind, to convey much inward and spiritual instruction.
God`'s design is to confound the wisdom of the wise,
and bring to naught the understanding of the prudent.
He has hid, and will hide divine things from the wise and prudent,
and reveals them unto babes.

The natural man not only _does not,_ but _cannot_ know them,
because they are only "`spiritually discerned.`"
To this purpose Christ spoke in parables,
that such as had an eye inward to the divine light,
which alone gives the true spiritual discerning, might understand, receive,
and know the mysteries of His kingdom, while all the wise and learned could but guess,
mistake, stumble, and be confounded.
So when the disciples asked Him why He spake in parables,
He informed them it was because it was given to them to know these things,
but to others it was not given.
It was not given to them to the exclusion of others in the same state of inward seeking,
docility, and child-like simplicity.

God`'s design was then, and ever will be,
to hide these things from all such as are striving
to know them by their own mere natural powers.
They may, and do study the Scriptures,
and reason very copiously upon them and think they clearly comprehend their meaning;
and yet remain in total darkness, as to the spiritual import, meaning,
and mystery of many passages which they are strongly persuaded they understand rightly.

Before this wisdom and creaturely comprehension the stumbling-block is,
by God`'s determination and counsel, _laid;_ on purpose laid,
that man ever may stumble and fall, and be snared and taken,
so long as he goes this way to work to understand divine things;
not that God determines any certain number of persons shall so stumble, and be snared,
etc., but all universally on this ground, and in this wisdom;
for through all ages it is true, "`if any man thinketh that he knoweth any thing,
he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.`"
Even Paul declares, "`I know nothing by myself.`"

[.blurb]
=== The Scriptures Sealed to Human Wisdom

The Scriptures will ever remain, in great degree,
a sealed book to the mere natural understandings of the wisest of men.
Volume after volume of commentaries have been written upon them, which, I have no doubt,
have often served, as a certain author has advanced, "`to entomb,
rather than enshrine them;`" or to darken, rather than explain their genuine meaning.
Thousands pass the time of their sojourning here below,
hoodwinked and muffled up in darkness,
under the baleful influence of this kind of theological
or systematical knowledge or speculation,
falsely called Divinity.
But in the midst of all this learned ignorance, and, in degree, acquired blindness,
which overruns the nations,
the God of grace is not wanting in the extension
of His own immediate rays upon the minds of men.
Those who turn from, disregard, and rebel against the light, are justly left in darkness,
for being, as those in Job`'s days, "`of them who rebel against the light,
they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.`"
But those who, while they "`have light, believe in the light,`" and walk in it,
"`they become the children of it,`" and are led into all truth.
To these in every age, and among all people,
God never fails to fulfill His promise of sending the Comforter
to lead and guide them in the way of holiness,
and unto the knowledge of all they need to know of divine things.

I may now proceed with my own exercises and openings.
It was clearly given me to behold many deep things in the visions of God;
things which the wisdom of the natural man,
though high in profession of divine knowledge, would probably laugh at and despise,
and were I to unfold them, would also despise me for my weakness.
But though I may not at present be permitted to unfold much,
I may say I have seen clearly to my full satisfaction, that Moses,
in writing of creation, of the fall of man,
and of things in the upright and in the fallen state,
wrote in the pure openings of divine light,
though very little understood by men in the first nature and state.
It is also plain and evident to my mind, in the light,
that the prophets saw things in the holy light of Jesus,
and spoke of them in very instructive metaphors and expressions, though hid from,
and unperceived by the wise and learned.

Many a sermon has been preached, by those who call themselves ministers of Christ,
upon parts of passages out of the prophets, and the rest of the Scriptures;
many heads of doctrine raised from them; many divisions and subdivisions made:
much explanation attempted; and much art and oratory displayed, while the life, marrow,
and main import of the passage remained entirely unseen and untouched by the speaker,
and little or no instruction was conveyed to the hearers,
all for want of a spiritual discerning of the true intent and meaning of the Scriptures.

=== Painful Meetings

Dined with my dear uncle Thomas Comstock, and rode to the Valley,
to a meeting appointed there at the fourth hour, afternoon.
It was a hard, painful meeting, covered with a thick dark cloud,
as when we were there before.
We were all shut up in painful silence, except myself, and I said only a few words,
not being quite easy to leave them without letting them know,
that I plainly felt a thick cloud of darkness hanging over the meeting.
I just dropped it, and left it.
Upon which one poor creature fell on his knees,
and called out with vehemency to the Lord, to rend the veil; as though he thought a loud,
noisy, passionate outcry could remove the clouds of darkness, when,
alas! it is the most likely way to cause them to gather and hang over a meeting.

Next day were at meeting at Isaiah Hoag`'s, called the upper meeting, a painful,
mournful, and distressing meeting, but, after deep travail, we were assisted,
and enabled to sound an alarm among them in a degree of gospel authority, and,
though I believe we felt truth and the seed of life under oppression;
yet as we lay low with it, and were made willing to suffer with it,
we were enabled to witness it to reign in dominion over all.

=== Grovelling in Earth--The Babylonish Garment.

Friends were advised to be no longer grasping after things unnecessary;
for the procuring of them leads us into much care, cumber, and expense of time,
thereby encroaching upon the time we ought to spend at meetings, visiting the sick, etc.,
and cuts us off from sufficient time for inward retirement in our families,
as well as taking care of the affairs of the church.
Now all those services, when rightly engaged in,
greatly tend to our growth and refinement,
and real comfort and happiness in this life and hereafter;
as also to the promotion of the cause of truth in the earth.
Oh! how mortals grovel here in earth, and earth`'s perplexing cares,
to their great loss of more substantial enjoyments! whereas,
if willing to be bounded by the girdle of truth,
we might have plenty of time for all our religious duties,
and have sufficient to spare to educate our children.
We were also concerned to caution against keeping superfluities,
and gay things to sell to others.

For if a young woman comes to a Friend`'s shop, to buy superfluities,
to deck and adorn herself with:
and supposing that this Friend has been concerned to advise
her to take up the cross to her own vain inclinations,
and live a self-denying life:
when she comes and finds his shop contains many things
directly fit and calculated to gratify these very inclinations,
and desires to purchase some of them, what can he say to her?
If he lets her have them, he hardens her heart against the advice he has given her,
by letting her see that gain will induce him to supply her
with things which he pretends to have a testimony against.
If he refuses to let her have them, what will he answer, when she asks him,
why he will tempt her with things, that he believes would be hurtful to her,
if she used them?

Oh! how the love of money prevails over mankind!
so that even those who can in a good degree,
deny themselves those vain and superfluous things which the giddy world delights in,
can yet, for the sake of profit,
keep those very things for sale which they believe are hurtful to those who use them.
Let none say, the people will have those things,
and they might as well buy them of Friends as others.
For so long as they see Friends give way to the love of money,
so far as to keep those things to supply them with,
they will not believe Friends have such a clear sense of the evil of such vain gratifications,
as they pretend to have; and so,
alas! the fashions and customs of a vain world will not fall before them.
Thus, while Israel is partaking of the accursed thing "`the wedge of gold,
and the Babylonish garment,`" the Israelitish army
will not be able to stand before their enemies;
but will more or less be forced to turn their backs and flee before them.
Oh! that a thorough reformation may take place among us!
What a people should we then be!
Lord, hasten Thy great work in the earth.

My companion was specially engaged to recommend love and unity,
and to guard against thinking lightly of each other, or despising one another,
because some do not exactly follow the other`'s footsteps.
I thought he handled the subject well and believe it was pertinent.

[.blurb]
=== Agony of Spirit

Rode about forty miles to Cloverick, where we attended their meeting next day.
I thought I should not be able to say a word,
or rise above the spirit that so clouded the meeting; but at length,
though in great weakness, we both dropped something among them in a plain, close way.
As to myself, I believe I was viewed as a fool among them; at least by some;
for I stood very long indeed between each short sentence, for a considerable time.
I also let them understand that the agony of my spirit had been such,
that I had been ready to say in my heart, "`Let this cup pass from me.`"
However, as I strove to keep resigned, way was at length made,
and life arose to some relief of mind.

My companion warned them against the love of money, and cares of this life;
and earnestly desired them to lay up treasure in heaven,
where neither moth nor rust can corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal.

=== No Excuse for an Irreligious Life.

Had a meeting at White Creek.
I sat silent, under a full persuasion, that the great lesson of inward, awful silence,
was very little learned, and lived up to among them.
Daniel called to a faithful subjection to the inward motions of truth;
showed that non-profession was no excuse for an irreligious life; that it was a plea,
that would stand none in any stead, in a trying time;
that we all have souls to save or lose; that he who neglected his soul`'s salvation,
though he made no profession, would meet with the same loss,
as he that neglected it under a profession; that is, the loss of his soul`'s happiness.
He also showed, that a mere simple belief that Christ died for us, would not save us;
we must obey His inward motions; submit to a daily self-denial, and bearing of the cross;
and suffer Him to save us _from,_ because He will not save us _in_ our sins.
I thought he was much favoured in _vocal,_ while I was closed up in a _silent_ testimony.

1st of 9th month.
Rode to a meeting over the river at Saratoga.
It was to me a time of awful silent waiting;
and though several subjects seemed to be opening on my mind, yet they all closed up,
and I had no liberty to say any thing among them.
Near the conclusion of the meeting, it sprang a little in my view,
and I thought likely I might have to mention it, that I had a little cabinet with me,
that contained a valuable treasure; but I was not the keeper of the key;
that He kept the key, who, and, on the contrary, when He shuts, none can open:
so as He did when He opens, none can shut; not open, I had nothing for the people.

[.blurb]
=== A Baptist Preacher Confounded

After meeting, we went home with James Seal, he being a friend of my acquaintance,
and one whom I loved, when he belonged to our Yearly Meeting.
Here came a Baptist preacher, who had been at the meeting.
Soon after he came in he began to discourse,
and seemed to manifest a disposition to dispute.
I felt a caution arise, not hastily to speak what was on my mind.
So keeping silence,
I had opportunity to hear him work round and try to get hold of something,
as he conversed with Daniel and the other Friend, till dinner was ready.
Also at the table, he manifested the same disposition,
and said he should like it better if Friends would state some propositions,
and clearly illustrate them, than to dwell much on exhortations, etc.,
meaning in public testimony, I suppose.
I remained silent till dinner was over; and then, before we rose from the table,
I felt an openness to speak.
First, I related the constrainings to silence, which I had felt in the meeting,
and what sprang in my mind near the close of it, respecting the little cabinet I had,
the key of which I was not the keeper of, etc.
And then enlarging a little, I added,
that I had found by trying to open something myself, I had run into words,
to the grief of my own mind, and not to the profit of the people.
And further, that by endeavouring to be methodical, I had sometimes lost the life,
in which the pure opening was, and so been also confused and confounded.
But that, by waiting in silence till the life hath arisen, and therein a living opening,
and by carefully moving, as the true key opened things,
suitable to the states of the people,
I had often known the power of Truth arise into great dominion,
to the consolation of my own soul, the great tendering of the people, and,
as I have no reason to doubt, to their real benefit, and spiritual advantage.

After thus expressing as things opened in a good degree of the influence of Truth,
the poor man seemed to be entirely shut up; and without making a word of reply,
arose from table, took his stick in his hand, and went away.
He soon after returned again, on some outward occasion,
but did not come into our company, and said nothing about religious matters.

Thus, that spirit,
wherein he appeared to think himself able to crush and to confound us all,
was overcome, and as it were chained, and bound fast in silence.
Let God have all the glory, as it is evidently due to Him.
For by waiting His time, He gave us the victory, and that without many words; whereas,
had we engaged this priest at a venture, and entered into a dispute with him,
in our own creaturely ability, as if our time was always ready,
it is very likely it might have led into a large field of words and arguments,
without much satisfaction on either side.
For, however sufficient Saul`'s armour might seem to encounter the vaunting Goliath with,
yet it would not do for little David.
But it was the sling and smooth stone that brought down the huge monster.
But, mark well, even _that_ must be under the direction,
and "`in the _name_ of the Lord,`" "`I come to Thee in the __Name of the Lord,`"__ said David.
And being thus qualified with that _name,_ which ever is the strong tower of the righteous,
he knew he was safe.
And though he used so simple a weapon as a sling and smooth stone,
it was so divinely directed as to go to the right place, and do great execution.
It sank into the giant`'s forehead, and he died.

Here is the wisdom, which to this world is foolishness.
And while those who depend not on the wisdom of the
creaturely ability in themselves or others,
are waiting for divine assistance, and are rejecting Saul`'s armour,
they appear as fools in the eyes of such, as,
in the greatness of their own sufficiency and importance,
are defying the armies of the living God.
But, however they may be despised, looked upon as fools,
and threatened with having their flesh given as food to the beasts,
and their carcasses to the fowls of the air,
as they do faithfully reject all self-sufficient human ability,
put entirely off Saul`'s armour, and wait till they can go forth in the _Name_ of the Lord,
although they have only a few plain, common words, smooth stones as it were,
they are certain, yea, sure of victory, for none ever trusted in the Lord,
and were confounded.

These remarks are made with a sincere desire, that myself,
and all who are engaged in the cause of truth, may at all times trust in the Lord,
and not lean to our own understandings; but carefully bear in mind,
that of ourselves we can do nothing; and that as it was with Jesus,
so it should be with us, viz. "`Mine hour is not yet come.`"

[.blurb]
=== The Propensity to Idolatry in Worship

+++[+++1784]
3rd of 9th month.
We were at a meeting appointed for us at a place called Pittstown,
where there is not a settled meeting.
It was held in a barn, and was a laborious trying meeting.
A number were present who were not members.
I sat in silence, and felt no opening of life till I was made willing,
which I clearly saw to be my duty,
to sit as one who had no expectation of saying anything to the people,
and to labour to find a little food or heavenly manna for my own soul,
as every true worshipper must do.
However, when I had attained to this pure resignation,
something arose in my mimd with life and strength: so I stood up and said,
"`The Lord hath been proving me,
whether I would attempt to warm myself with the sparks of my own kindling:
but I have learned to know, that if I do, I shall lie down in sorrow,
according to Scripture testimony.`"
I also mentioned Israel`'s making an image,
when Moses had been absent from them in the mount only forty days;
and that they were so weak and ignorant as to say, "`These be thy gods, O Israel,
which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.`"
I then mentioned that the same disposition or propensity to idolatry,
was natural to the mind of man, to this day; that every attempt to worship God,
either by preaching, praying, or singing, without His immediate motion and influence,
was will-worship and idolatry; and that though under the law of Moses,
He required burnt offerings, incense, etc., yet when not rightly performed,
He rejected them, and said, Bring no more vain oblations; new moons,
and your solemn feasts, my soul hateth.
Thus I enlarged and urged the absolute necessity of waiting in awful stillness,
in the silence of all flesh,
till we receive the commission and command of Him
who will be worshipped in spirit and in truth.
On sitting down, I soon felt a fresh spring,
to call the people to an honest waiting upon, and obedience to the inward Teacher;
and something very unexpectedly sprang in my mind, while standing,
on the subject of everlasting punishment and destruction.
This I perceived took deep hold on the minds of some;
although the most present appeared very hard to reach.
However, it was to me a time of divine favour and satisfaction.

[.blurb]
=== The Resurrection

We were at Danby meeting, in Vermont.
Deep exercise and baptism attended my mind till toward the close of the meeting,
when my companion arose twice; but the exercise of my mind was such,
that I hardly remember a word he said.
Soon after he last sat down, I was engaged to stand up, and said, "`If the dead rise not,
then is Christ not risen,`" and added,
"`However many may understand this of the resurrection of the body,
and whatever meaning it may have in relation thereto, yet it has been opened to my mind,
in the visions of light, that unless the dead in us arise, and is quickened,
then is not Christ risen to and in us.`"
I expressed my deep sense of death`'s reigning over many minds in the meeting,
and sounded the alarm, '`"`Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead,
and Christ shall give thee light.`' Here it appears that there is something in us,
that must be raised from the dead, before we come to be filled with light,
and to know that Christ is really risen in our souls.
Here also we know not only a '`being buried with him by baptism
into death,`' but a rising with Him in '`the likeness of His resurrection`':
and feel, and livingly know Him, to be the '`resurrection and the life,`' to our souls.`"

I also mentioned the Apostle`'s question, "`Else why are we baptized for the dead?`"
and that my soul had been baptized for the dead in a painful travail,
that such as sat in death and darkness, might arise and be quickened.
It also livingly opened, that when He, whom neither death nor the grave could hold,
arose from the dead, He arose not alone, but even the dead bodies of saints which slept,
arose and came out of their graves, and went into the holy city.
These things were uttered and enlarged upon,
in the evidence and demonstration of the Spirit,
and with power far beyond what I now write.
For indeed I clearly saw, yea, can much clearer than ever I did before,
that an important meaning of the Apostle`'s doctrine, concerning the rising of the dead,
was that of being quickened, and knowing that in us, over which death has reigned,
to be made alive.

This was a meeting wherein I thought truth triumphed and had the dominion,
through deep suffering.
Many minds were reached and tendered.
But I had to believe too many of them had been living at ease,
and to fear they would continue so,
notwithstanding they may be now and then much affected.
Oh! that they may be effectually aroused, and awakened before it be too late.
However, I believe there is a little, living remnant at Danby,
who fear the Lord and strive to serve Him faithfully.

[.blurb]
=== Sits Long in Travailing Silence

We appointed a meeting at a place called Durham, about twenty miles northward of Danby,
of which notice was given, and we attended it accordingly,
and had satisfactory service therein,
though among a people not much acquainted with Friends,
and exceedingly outward in their expectations,
and unacquainted with the advantages of inward waiting in solemn silence upon God.

I had a great desire to be favoured with an opening of something to say to them,
but as I determined to know nothing among them but Jesus Christ and him crucified,
and not to presume to speak a word without the Master`'s commission,
I had long to sit in tribulating, travailing silence, having no divine opening at all,
till I was made willing wholly to die to that desire
I had of having something to say to the people.
But as I gave it all up, and sank down into nothingness and self-abasement,
I found a work to do, and Oh! how was I straitened until it was accomplished.
How did I travail in birth, that Christ might be formed in them,
and that they might come into a living acquaintance with Him in spirit,
and no longer stand gazing, as it were, up into heaven, to look for Him from without,
or at a distance, as if He were to be known again after the flesh,
though the Apostle declared that "`henceforth know we Him so no more.`"
I laboured to turn the eye and attention of their minds inward,
and to impress them with a sense of the necessity of an inward heart-work,
and of that inward labour,
wherein Zion travaileth in pain to be delivered and wherein the true seed
of Jacob still wrestles for the blessing and obtains it,
not flinching, nor giving out, until the break of day, and a change of name is witnessed;
the white stone received,
which is only by him that overcometh and the new name therein written,
which none knows but him that hath received it.
Now, as this is experienced, the soul comes to be indeed a prince, like Jacob,
the wrestler, having power with God and man, and prevailing.

[.blurb]
=== Spiritual Attendants Encircle Him

We took our affectionate leave of our dear friends, and set forward for home,
accompanied by beloved friend Ebenezer Smith.
My mind was much affected, and after parting with Friends,
with great tenderness and tears of joy, which, for a considerable space of time,
flowed copiously from mine eyes.
I suppose I rode more than a dozen miles under this sensation,
being altogether indisposed for conversation.
My mind was carried back to view the places where we had visited;
and my soul was melted into ardent mental supplication
for the preservation of Friends in general,
and many individuals in particular:
attended with such endeared affection and brokenness of spirit,
as has rarely been my lot to witness for so long a time together.
Oh! with what heartfelt fervency did I intercede for the
help and preservation of the little flock and family,
up and down in the world!
Oh! the earnest requests that I was enabled to put up for the instruction
and divine assistance of the many messengers of the Lord,
who are running to and fro in the earth, among the people;
that their labours may prove successful, and benefit the souls of mankind.

Indeed the language of solemn supplication ran powerfully through my mind,
with a melting sensibility, for all; that the dead might be raised, quickened,
and made alive, in that life which is hid with Christ in God.
Many individuals of my acquaintance, both in places where I had visited abroad,
and also at home in our own and neighbouring Monthly Meetings,
came fresh into my remembrance, with such ardency of desire, and breathings of soul,
for their growth, preservation, and improvement,
as will not readily be conceived by such as have not felt the same.

Yea, my desires for them were conceived in intelligent language in the secret of my soul,
in a number of little, short, though sweet and melting requests for one after another,
as the Father of spirits brought them to my remembrance.

Oh! how often did it flow through me as a stream of life on this wise
"`O most mighty and omnipotent Lord God! commissionate Thine holy angels
to attend and guard Thy exercised pilgrims through this vale of tears!
Let cherubim and seraphim encamp about and surround the little host of militants,
Thy wrestling seed, while here on earth, and forevermore.`"
Oh! how did my bosom heave with swelling tides of joy and divine delight; yea,
all that was in me moved!
My heart, my head, yea, my whole man, seemed encircled round with spiritual attendants,
whose melodious and ecstatic songs of praise enraptured my soul,
and lifted me above all earth`'s tumultuous cares and all its fading joys!
And in the midst of this triumphant adoration,
my eyes were opened to see and view the depths of sufferings
and abasement which my soul had passed through in my visit:
then did I see that the true wrestling seed of Jacob can never rejoice,
but through sufferings; abound, but through abasement; nor yea,
all live and reign with the Lamb that was dead and is alive, but through death.
I then was given to behold as it were around me, as I rode on the way,
an innumerable multitude of glorified spirits; and it was said in the centre of my soul,
"`These are they which came out of great tribulation, having washed their robes,
and made them white, in the blood of the Lamb,`" their ever-living Redeemer.

I saw that I must yet longer endure the cup of sufferings in this house of clay,
if I would join the songs of those ransomed souls in never-ending anthems of praise;
to which I bowed my head and heart, saying, Lord, let not Thine eye pity,
nor Thy hand spare, until Thou hast done away all that offends in me,
and brought forth judgment into victory in my soul.

And when I had thus submitted and offered up body, soul, and spirit, into His holy hands,
a willing sacrifice,
it was showed me how good it had been for me that I had so deeply suffered; and that,
had it been otherwise, I should have missed of this feast of fat things.
Next it was showed me,
that though I had not altogether done the best that
I might have done while on this visit,
yet that I had been been preserved in the meekness, littleness, and humility; and,
to my inexpressible satisfaction, I was also shewn, and made to see, feel, and know,
that nothing was laid to my charge as an offence to stand against me;
but feeling there was now no condemnation to my soul,
I was made to join the heavenly harmony; and,
in that angelic spring of adoration which I felt, my soul within me leaped for joy, and,
at the end of this transporting chorus, my inmost language was, "`Sing praises,
sing praises, sing praises.
Amen, amen: Hallelujah!`"
At which it seemed as if the whole expanse of heaven rang with acclamations of joy,
thanksgiving, and praise.

After which,
I again had freedom to enter into innocent and pleasant conversation with my two friends,
which I had not done for miles before, as we rode on the way;
but I kept the vision pretty much to myself,
save what of its effects they discovered in my countenance, and the tears I had shed,
which I had not power to restrain.
Lord! never suffer me to forget Thy favours and divine communications,
but as Thou hast begun to clothe my mind with humility, be pleased more and more,
to centre me deep into it, that I may wear it as a garment forever.

[.blurb]
=== Veneration to the Instrument

I verily believe some pay such a degree of veneration to the instrument,
as to rob Him without whom the instrument can do nothing rightly,
of a part of the acknowledgment, and homage due to him.
And if the poor instrument is not well grounded in humility,
it may greatly injure him also.
Though, indeed, I do verily believe _that_ instrument,
who every time he offers anything in the ministry, waits in true silence,
out of all self-activity, till Truth opens his way, and moves no further therein,
than this is the case, will not, while thus exercised,
ever get exalted above the lowliness of a self-denying follower of the meek Redeemer.
For, if he goes on in this manner, he will be stripped and emptied so entirely,
in almost all the meetings he visits, at least for a time,
that he will be far enough from self-exaltation.
But when ministers grow weary of suffering, and begin to make likenesses and images,
and to preach themselves, and not Christ Jesus moving before He moves them; then,
alas! the danger of self-exaltation is great indeed, especially if they are eloquent,
for too many people are more pleased and transported with false-likenesses,
than with the mortifying labours of such as keep down to the pure Witness,
in the littleness and lowliness of true gospel labours.
The people being thus pleased, are not generally wanting, or backward, to manifest it,
in a manner that seldom fails to elevate such ministers
from the flockings and praise of the multitude.
And Oh! the danger that such are in, from the flockings and praise of the multitude.

Blessed be that holy Arm, that has humbled my soul, led me about,
instructed me in self-abasement, and kept me as the apple of His eye, yea,
and through deep sufferings, led me into the green pasture of life,
and made my cup to overflow with the oil of gladness to my inexpressible joy and consolation.

[.blurb]
=== Trials, Temptations

About this time I had some trying exercises in the course of my practice of physic;
but I found patience was good in these cases,
and that divine wisdom was profitable to direct therein.
I think I may also mention,
that after all my past experience of heavenly good and divine favour,
I had to encounter some of the most trying and potently
pressing temptations of my soul`'s enemy that ever I endured;
even so that I often, for months, almost despaired of overcoming.
Let him that thinketh he standeth, be not high-minded, but fear.
Let none think themselves safe off the watch,
because of any degree of attainment and favour.
The watch-tower remains to be our place of safety.
Neither let any honest mind be too much disheartened at the assaults of Satan.
There is a power above him,
and he that cleaves close to it shall know a victory over all the powers of darkness,
and therein witness that there is no enchantment against the rightly wrestling Jacob,
nor divination against God`'s faithful, dependent, persevering Israel.
This I think my soul has a right to set its seal to, as I have ever come off victorious,
when I have not turned my back upon the Light, our divine leader.

Sing, O ye heavens! and O ye pilgrims on the earth,
rejoice and triumph! for strong and invincible is the God of our salvation:
and abundantly sufficient for our help is the grace afforded us!
Let us but keep to it, and then safe are their steppings, and sure their preservation;
for, however severe their trials, the Lord will be near them; and indeed,
in the midst of temptation He will often lift up a standard
that shall vanquish all the influence of every evil spirit,
and set the soul on the everlasting foundations, that cannot be shaken.
Oh! how often did the unslumbering Shepherd of Israel, the great Bishop of souls,
arise for my deliverance when I seemed to myself just ready to fall a victim
to the grand adversary! how did He not only give power of resistance;
but fill my soul with the overflowing of His love beyond all expression!
Worthy forever to be waited for, worshipped, and obeyed, is the Lord, the God of Israel,
the mighty Friend of the faithful.

[.blurb]
=== Eternal Punishment

I now come to mention a concern that had exercised my mind for some years,
A notion has been very industriously propagated in this country,
that all souls will enjoy eternal salvation, however wicked.
And this doctrine being preached up by many,
and several books being printed in vindication of it,
I became engaged in spirit to write something in support of the
true Christian doctrine of future endless rewards and punishments.
This I did in answer to a piece called "`Union,`" etc., by James Relley;
and by some more general remarks on the subject,
with many pertinent passages of Scripture; which,
being laid before our Meeting for Sufferings, was, after some amendments,
approved and liberty granted by them to print it.

[.blurb]
=== Clear Openings without Words

It is sometimes wisely ordered,
that precious and divine openings are treasured up in the Lord`'s treasury;
but how dangerous would it be to squander them away, and lavish them out among people,
only because we are favoured with the openings, however clear and even instructive,
without the word of command, and the divine necessity to deliver them to the people.

Have not too many fallen here, taken the opening, for a commission to appear,
and so got into a lifeless, formal ministry?
Which, though it may often be in great seeming heat, animation, and fervency,
with a flow of fine words, and perhaps sound words merely as words,
yet is very burdensome to the living members, the true wrestling Israel of God,
who cannot be satisfied with a tinkling cymbal, or sounding brass,
however pleasing to the itching ears of such, who, as Thomas Ellwood says, "`seldom try,
beyond the outward ear, or outward eye.`"

[.blurb]
=== Stepping Aside in the Ministry

+++[+++1786]. Few friends live here +++[+++Newtown]. I thought, as I was speaking,
according to clear openings, the matter was too deep for most present;
and therefore as if I, poor weak worm,
could steer my own course better than the great Pilot,
or better suit my subject to the states of the people, I stepped aside from the opening,
and with a view to condescend to the people`'s condition,
struck upon more familiar and more common matters,
in illustrating Truth`'s gradual teachings; but, alas!
I found it is truly _not in man that walketh to direct his own steps_ in this great work,
for instead of instructing the people, I soon dried up the spring of life I felt before;
and I sat down in a degree of shame and confusion,
being taught thereby to _trust in the Lord with all my heart,
and lean not_ to my own understanding.

[.blurb]
=== Much Parade and Cookery

For so much parade and cookery as we perceived at some Friends`' houses,
is very burdensome, and very unbecoming our plain Christian profession,
and is what we neither learn, nor can ever justify,
from the example or precepts of Christ, our great pattern.
But oh! we love to call Him Lord, and to be thought His servants,
better than to bear His cross; and yet it will forever remain true, "`No Cross,
no Crown.`"

+++[+++At Plainfield]
My mouth was opened in an alarming testimony among them in the meeting for worship,
and Joseph`'s in solemn supplication,
that the _last days_ of such as had long been gathering rust, might,
by the fire and the hammer, be their best days.

[.blurb]
=== Turning Back to Egypt

We had a meeting at Alloways-Creek.
The state of such as thought themselves rich _and increased_ in goods, etc.,
and yet had too much neglected to buy "`gold tried
in the fire,`" that they might be rich,
and "`white raiment,`" that they might be clothed, sprang fresh in my mind,
with God`'s wonderful dealings with Israel, in bringing them out of Egypt,
and through the wilderness; their singing His praise, and soon forgetting His works;
turning back in their minds to go to Egypt, and lusting after the fleshpots, onions,
and garlic; also their backsliding disposition, after entering the promised land;
together with the sad apostasy that so soon overtook the Christian church,
departing from the life of religion, so divinely enjoyed in primitive times,
among the apostles and believers;
with a view of the several buddings forth of religious life in different appearances,
and different people, one after another,
previous to the gathering of the Society of Friends: and how according to accounts,
those very people in whom these good beginnings, stirrings,
and breathings after the divine presence were witnessed, did, one after another,
very soon set down at ease, in one form or another.

But as they neglected and departed from the power,
the Lord of life departed from them and from their forms,
as set forth in William Penn`'s [.book-title]#Rise and Progress of the People called Quakers,#
and divers sketches in the writings of Isaac Penington.
These things opening with weight and clearness on my mind: and sensibly believing,
that the Almighty would as much reject us and our plain form,
as any other people and form whatever in any particular
place or meeting where we depart from the life and power.
I stood up and opened these views in a good degree of Truth`'s favouring authority,
and in the dominion of life and power: yet I believe there is a remnant among them,
who are, in a good degree, alive in the truth: may these be strengthened,
and their number increased.

This meeting, though very painful and dull in the forepart,
was comfortably refreshing in the conclusion.

=== Missing the Crown of Gold

Attended the Quarterly Meeting, going into it under great weakness and want;
but soon after sitting down, the power of the Word of life arose,
in freshness and dominion, with an opening clear and living;
wherein I felt a necessity to stand up and proclaim the word of the Lord among them.
But it being a very large meeting,
and several great and eminent ministers of the gospel present,
it was no small cross to me to appear among them.
However, I was pretty soon made willing to yield to the pressing motions of Truth,
and therein standing up,
was favoured to speak closely to the states of such
as had not been faithful to divine manifestations,
and even some who had known their heads to be crowned as it were with crowns of gold;
and yet had so fallen short, that, if they did not arise and trim their lamps,
I believed the kingdom would be rent from them, their crowns taken from their heads,
and given to others that were better than they.
But I had also a comfortable prospect of many truly tender, religious minds present,
and hopeful young people a valuable number; and it opened in me to say,
I believed the children were already born who would live to see a better day,
and enjoy the overspreading canopy of divine love in a more eminent degree,
through faithfulness, than what many now do.
It was a precious and heavenly opportunity,
and divers living testimonies were borne by brethren present,
to the rejoicing of many hearts.

My mind +++[+++at the Falls, Pa.]
was favoured in testimony to the glorious gospel of Christ,
as effectually witnessed in and by many in our and our forefathers`' days: and which,
as I believe, will yet more abundantly be witnessed among the nations;
for I do believe the Lord is arising to shake terribly the earth,
and that multitudes will be brought to the inward knowledge of this glorious truth,
"`Christ in you, the hope of glory.`"

[.blurb]
=== Decently and in Order

Attended the youth`'s meeting here, a pretty favoured time on the whole.
Joseph had good service in lively testimony among them.
I was quite calm and easy, without a word in that way.
We had in this meeting, nine testimonies and a prayer.
The apostle says, "`Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the others judge.`"
Now though I have never thought that this by any means confines a meeting to two,
three or four appearances in public testimony:
yet I think it is worthy of serious consideration, whether truth, strictly attended to,
and its leadings deeply waited for, would, after two or three lively, powerful,
and moderately lengthy testimonies, often lead to many further additions?
And whether such additions are not, in general, as apt to hurt, as help the meeting?
I would by no means limit to any number of appearances,
nor cramp the right concern of any: but I do fear, that out of the fulness of good will,
and warmth of desire for the good and advancement of the hearers,
meetings are sometimes hurt by unprofitable additions, and the savour,
under which they might have concluded, in some degree taken off.
Our God is a God of order; and if we keep to His leadings,
_all things will be done decently and in order._

[.blurb]
=== A Tendering among the Youth

We had a meeting at Makefield, where, after deep exercise,
truth rose at length into great dominion,
and divers living testimonies were borne to the great tendering of many minds,
especially among the youth, many of whom were present,
and pressingly and powerfully persuaded to choose the Lord for their portion.
Indeed it was a precious time to them,
and a large number of them were very much reached and broken:
may they live under a sense of it.
Backsliders were also pressingly warned, and truth was over all:
blessed be the powerful Helper of the truly dependent, for He is their only hope,
and their rock of defence in all their exercises; and they learn and know,
from multiplied experience, that without Him they can do nothing, in a religious line,
that will either please Him, or profit the people, or their own souls.
But, oh! the wonderful and inexpressible light, life, power, and dominion,
wherein He arises at times for the help, comfort,
and encouragement of His faithful servants!
Words fall short in expression thereof, and language cannot reach it!
Therefore bow, O my soul, in silent, humble prostration,
and reverential gratitude and awe, before Him the Lord God omnipotent that reigneth;
bless Him, praise Him, and adore Him forever; for He is worthy to be sought unto,
trusted in, worshipped, and obeyed, and that by the whole house of Israel, can my soul,
in feeling thankfulness and awful sensibility, at this time testify and declare!
Amen.

[.blurb]
=== Rejects Beautiful Openings

I sat long in silence; many presentations attended my mind,
but as I waited for the Word of life,
I saw there were many subjects on which a man might either muse or speak,
divers fields of doctrine, a large scope for choice;
but alas! we cannot choose aright for ourselves, anymore than we know what to pray for,
without assistance.
So I was made willing to reject all these false openings, however beautiful;
and sinking down into the silence of all flesh,
this pertinent lesson was opened to my mind: "`Ever remember,
when thou approachest before thy God, in order to worship Him,
that of thyself thou canst do nothing: that thy business is, to wait in true silence,
avoiding all imaginary workings of thought, and all self-active motions, cogitations,
and conceivings; feeling thy relationship, thy sonship, therein crying, Abba, Father:
and in a sensible communion with Him that made thee,
experiencing that He has graven thee upon the palms of His hands;
therein breathing to Him for help and instruction; not presuming to stir him up,
nor awake him, before he pleases: nor to form unto thyself a graven image;
nor to presume to warm thyself by the sparks of thy own kindling,
lest thou lie down in sorrow.

Though thou mayest feel thy mind ever so empty and barren, keep in true resignation.
Keep the word of His patience, and He will keep thee in the hour of temptation.
Be careful for nothing, but in everything, with fervent supplication,
let thy request be made known unto God.
Keep strictly on the watch-tower.
Watch and pray continually.
Be ardent in thy desires after divine aid and assistance;
but shut thine eyes against every false presentation.
Slack not thy watchful waiting, wrestling, intercession with Heaven.
Trust in the Lord with all thy heart, and lean not to thine own understanding.
This is the height of divine worship, the summit of devotion,
and the most acceptable offering to God; for thy mind, in worship,
ought ever to be a perfect blank, except only the feeling of thy sonship,
and the cry of Abba, Father! with thy ardent desires unto Him for help.

"`As thou art faithful in this charge, and upright in this exercise, I will never leave,
fail, nor forsake thee.
For though I seem to tarry long, I will come;
and will not tarry longer than shall be for thy good, and the good of my people.
And when I do come, my reward is with me, and my work before me;
and I will set thy work in order before _thee,_ and enable thee to perform it,
even to thy own admiration, in far other,
and more satisfactory manner than all thy own faculties
and highest flights of imagination can ever attain to.
Only be thou still, and wait my time, and my word of life and command, and I will open,
and none shall shut.
But when I shut, neither thou nor any else can ever open.
I will be unto thee mouth and wisdom, tongue and utterance.
Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.`"

[.blurb]
=== Fulness of Divine Sufficiency

We went to Mount Holly, and attended a meeting that had been appointed there for me.
It was indeed a most melting, favoured time;
exhortation and prayer were both eminently attended with life and divine authority.
A more evident fulness of divine sufficiency in solemn supplication I perhaps never knew:
for which my heart was and is awfully bowed to the God and Father of all our mercies,
to whom I bend the knee, and reverently acknowledge Him as my only helper,
and all-sufficient support.

However, I had to see that things were much out of order at this place,
and was divinely enabled to point out and speak to several conditions,
believing spiritual blindness had, at least in part,
overtaken some who had once seen clearer; some were lame, were halting,
some I thought were greatly withered, and some I thought resembled the _dry bones,_
concerning which it was queried, "`can these dry bones live?`"
To all these states I had to speak a word of reproof, of lamentation,
and also of encouragement yet to hope, to wait for and seek after strength,
and therein to arise and press forward: for even the _dry bones did live._
But above all,
the animating word of persuasion and encouragement flowed powerfully to the tender youth,
like a river of living water through my soul to them!
Blessed be the Lord for every favour.

After meeting we made a comfortable visit to our dear ancient friend,
the widow of that worthy, self-denying valiant of the Lord, John Woolman,
and to their daughter, with her husband and children.
The widow was in a meek, humble, loving frame of mind.
I think the Lord is with her, and believe He will be with her.

[.blurb]
=== A Call to Weeping

We had a meeting at Vincent Town, and, after long silence,
I had to _weep a little as between the porch and the altar,_
and called those met with us to do the like,
for I feared the heritage would be given to reproach, the heathen rule over them,
and say among the people, where is their God.
John joined me in sounding an alarm; and they were called to mourning,
and to teach their children lamentation!
After meeting I rode back to Mount-Holly, then to Burlington,
so crossed the Delaware to Bristol,
and home with my dear ancient friend James Moon who
had been so kind as thus far to accompany me.

[.blurb]
=== The Inward Temple Filled

+++[+++1786. Yearly meeting at Philadelphia.]
The last sitting of the select meeting was this day divinely owned,
as were divers of the preceding,
with the Lord`'s glory filling the inward temple of the spiritual house,
in such a manner as to induce a living remnant to cry in the secret of their souls,
"`Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord: hosanna in the highest.`"
In the course of this Yearly Meeting my mind was often bowed
in a sense of the Lord`'s condescending kindness,
not only in favouring me with strength and ability,
but also in opening the hearts of many deeply experienced ministers
and elders to receive and sympathize with me in my labours;
for which the holy Name be praised, and let all ever bow before Him.

I attended their Monthly Meeting,
+++[+++Market Street+++]+++ and was livingly and very unexpectedly
opened in truth`'s testimony against the love,
spirit, and friendship of the world, and to call Friends into a labour in their families,
and among their dear offspring.
This was extensively an alarming day,
and I hope some of them will profitably take the alarm.
My soul had great peace: blessed be the holy Helper.

[.blurb]
=== Empty and Blind

I attended the youth`'s general meeting at Byberry, and suffered still in silence,
feeling myself as a stranger, a pilgrim on the earth; and, in the depth of my distress,
I said in my heart, Lord, why hast Thou thus forsaken me?
Thou knowest I have given up all that is near and dear to
me in this world to follow Thee and Thy call into this land;
my dear wife and tender offspring I have left behind me,
and come forth thus far into a land I knew not; and I can appeal to Thee,
O my God! that it is only in obedience to Thy will and requirings.
Why then am I thus left?
why feel I myself so destitute and forsaken of all good?
why see I no way cast up to walk in?
Thus, or to this purpose, I bemoaned my desolate condition,
and spread my case before the Lord my God with tears,
but all in a good degree of resignation; and after a little space,
being fully satisfied all would work for good, I was made willing to be as poor, empty,
and blind, as the Lord would have me to be, and all centred in this: "`Not my will,
but Thine be done.`"

[.blurb]
=== Silent in Eleven Meetings

Had meeting at Pottsgrove, +++[+++Philadelphia], wherein truth rose into dominion,
and my faith and assurance of the all-sufficiency of truth`'s openings and leadings,
were greatly increased;
for I had sat through eleven meetings in silence one after another,
except a very few words just at the close of the first of them.
Now, in all these silent meetings I could never once, except those few words,
find ability or openness to say a single word,
and believe my silence was wholly ordered of God, though contrary to the desires of many,
and even part of the time very unpleasant to my own mind,
but it pleased my great Master to keep me to it,
until I was made to yield and be content with whatever
He pleased to allot unto me in my pilgrimage,
however it might induce the ignorant to gaze upon me as a fool.

And after I had thus surrendered up all, He was pleased to open my mouth,
in a very comfortable manner to myself, and I believe to some others.
In this meeting I felt the power of the word of Life
almost as soon as I sat down in the house,
but the opening was on a very unexpected subject,
a disposition striving to comprehend the unfathomable mysteries of the inscrutable God.
This was the subject that opened in the Light and in the life,
and as I kept to the opening I had much to say on this and several other subjects,
with considerable in a way of comfort and encouragement to a tried,
afflicted state; and being favoured with the spirit of supplication,
the meeting ended to good satis- faction.
After meeting I was informed that such an inquisitive,
diving disposition after hidden mysteries was present in that meeting,
and also the other state of affliction and probation.
Blessed be the Lord for all His fatherly dispensations,
however disagreeable to my own inclinations.

[.blurb]
=== The Work Marred on the Wheel

I was now renewedly made sensible what is meant by His leading
"`the blind by a way they know not,`" and by the query,
"`Who is so blind as the Lord`'s servants, and the messengers whom He sends?`"
I also see it necessary to be so: for till we arrive to this state,
we are in danger of carving for ourselves, and robbing God of His glory,
who is never in his proper dominion in us, until He becomes our _all in all:_
and our whole trust and dependance is on Him alone,
without leaning to our own understandings.

The want of this has marred the work on the wheel, and, I fear, ruined many,
who have begun well, and run well for a season, but, growing weary of waiting,
of poverty, and self-abasement, they have let up the active, wise, self-sufficient part,
and so run out into a multitude of words without life,
and yet often under pretence of great openings.
And some have become very visionary,
and pretend often to be seeing into the state of things, where they are,
and where they go, and yet all, or too much, in the airy, flighty, uncertain region,
where self-activity is uppermost and unbridled;
though they seem not fully sensible of it, and can scarcely bear to be told of it.
All this comes to pass for want of depth enough in waiting in the silence of all flesh.

May the Lord open the eyes of all the well-disposed,
that they may see and shun the snares of the enemy.
For it is not only among young beginners that this is to be discovered,
but even among too many that seem far advanced,
at least in their own and many of their friends`' estimation.
And I have seen a danger, to attend the once humble, careful traveller,
when by a circumspect progress he has been enabled to satisfy his brethren of the reality
of his commission and has become established in their minds as a real gospel minister.
For now, if he is not very careful to lie low before the Lord, he may, after all,
make shipwreck of his gift;
and by giving way to a disposition to deck and adorn himself with God`'s jewels,
he may cause dimness to come over that, which once shined with clearness and brightness,
in and through him, when he stood only as the Lord`'s trumpet,
and had nothing of his own to depend upon.

Alas! the danger we are in, when we begin to think we stand;
for then we have great need to take heed lest we fall.
And I have ever found, that, thinking we are humble, may, and sometimes does,
become an inlet to spiritual pride.

Therefore, let all not only get down into littleness, yea, nothingness of self,
but abide there.
Oh! it is a great thing to abide there rightly.
For self, the adversary, is apt to be getting up again,
in a kind of disguised hidden manner;
and that of keeping rightly down is a very great work,
and requires many deep baptisms to attain to it.
And he that once begins to think he has attained to it,
it is very likely that self is beginning or about to show its head again.
Let us therefore, look unto the Lord, and trust only in him,
not daring to lean to our own understanding.

I am a pilgrim on the earth.
Lord! wherein Thou seest I have, in any thing, done contrary to Thy holy will,
be pleased to open mine eyes to see it; and enable me this day,
and all the days of my life, so to conduct and demean myself before Thee,
as that I may witness Thy approbation, and feel Thy divine favour.

[.blurb]
=== The Dependent State

I went to the Monthly Meeting at Horsham, and after viewing the camp a while in silence,
had to lift up my voice like a trumpet and sound an alarm among them,
as wishing them to flee for their lives, lest, ere they were aware,
and while sitting carelessly at ease, the enemy should surround them and swallow them up.

After this I sat in a low,
suffering state through the whole transactions of their business;
but just at the close my trumpet was again prepared to sound;
and feeling strength to arise out of great weakness, and light out of obscurity,
I so renewed the alarm among them, as to feel quite easy and comfortable in my mind.
Blessed be the Lord who helped me; for I sensibly felt,
that had not His power arisen for my deliverance,
I must have sunk down under a load of distress, and gone away burdened in spirit,
having no might nor ability to throw my heavy load off myself.
Indeed I grew weaker and weaker, blinder and blinder, in myself;
but herein I truly rejoice, for it brings into the clearness,
into deep dependence upon God alone,
whereby His grace is felt to be all-sufficient and an unshaken evidence given,
that with the divine Arm there is no lack.

Many deep lessons of instruction are opened in this dependent state,
and revealed to the babe,
which had utterly escaped the penetration of the wise and prudent.
Therefore, O Lord! ever keep me low enough before Thee.
I have so clearly seen this to be the only way for divine enlargement and true consolation,
that I desire it, I crave it of Thee, more earnestly than corn, wine, or oil.

Oh! what numbers miss of the best instruction and the purest joy, by continuing,
even after great mortification, alive in themselves in their religious performances.
These cannot fully say, "`I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.`"
These have in them something of the beast which received
the wound by the sword of the Spirit,
and yet did live; the deadly wound being healed.
All these are in imminent danger; and if they are not aware,
they will retard the work of the Lord, in themselves and in others,
through their busy attempts to promote it;
and yet perhaps they may be pretending to wait for,
and giving out that they feel much divine influence.

[.blurb]
=== The Subltety of the Serpent

Oh! the subtlety of the serpent, especially in his resemblance of an angel of light!
Many hath he caught, beguiled, and ruined.
The pure openings of life are very different,
and distinguishable from all his false visions and likenesses.
The deep, humble, careful traveller finds it so to his unspeakable satisfaction; and yet,
how many are taking the latter for the former,
for want of depth and patience enough in waiting!
Hereby the innocent, precious life in them becomes wounded,
and the true simplicity betrayed,
for "`the adulteress will hunt,`" even "`for the precious life,`" as the wise man testifies.
And I believe the truly wise in heart, not in earthly wisdom, but heavenly,
do really find it so; for the _Life_ is the very thing the adversary strikes at,
and if he can keep us from the sensible feelings
and openings thereof in our religious engagements,
he cares not how active we are without it, and how much we pretend to it,
for the more of all this, the securer he hath us,
and the more we promote his kingdom and interest.
Oh! where will many appear at last, after all the cry of "`Lord, Lord,
have not we prophesied in Thy name, and in Thy name cast out devils,
and done many wonderful or mighty works?`"

[.blurb]
=== The Narrow Path and a Dangerous Delusion

This is a subject that greatly engages my attention,
in earnest wishes that thou who readest these hints may be preserved out of,
and wisely shun the dreadful snare, and yet have a care of disobedience.
But when things open in the light, give up to the heavenly vision,
and confer not with flesh and blood.
The path, though narrow, may yet be travelled in.
It is a way wherein all the true wayfaring men, though fools, may walk and not err:
but then they must carefully attend to the _way-marks,_ as the _light,_ and that _only,_
makes them manifest; keeping a _single eye_ thereto,
never once beginning to think of taking less heed to it, or that now,
after much experience, they can do pretty well with less clearness,
and less bright shining thereof, than heretofore.
For, alas! this is a mistake and dangerous delusion,
and he that continues to give way to it, will soon walk in darkness,
not knowing whither he goeth; his feet will stumble in the dark,
until he falls into the bottomless pit, with the beast and false prophet.
But thou, whose eye is kept carefully single and attentive to the _light,_
shalt witness thy whole body to be full of light, and shalt journey forward safely,
until thou arrivest at that city that needs not the light of the sun nor the moon,
for the Lord God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.
Amen.

[.blurb]
=== The Pure Testimony Exalted

In the forenoon I attended Market Street meeting,
and soon feeling a very weighty concern resting on my spirit,
I stood up in the fresh openings of life; and began to express what I had in commission;
but keeping carefully to the divine guide, I soon felt all to be shut up again,
whereupon I immediately sat down,
rejoicing that I was preserved from proclaiming _without life,_
what just before was opened _in the life:_ so I sat quite easy,
being delivered from the great weight and exercise which I had felt,
until towards the end of the meeting,
and after another friend had well declared the truth among us;
when I again stood up and very fully cleared my mind; setting the pure,
simple testimony of truth, over the high, soaring, creaturely-wise,
and comprehending part, which puzzles and puzzles the minds of too many,
in a vain and ever fruitless attempt to investigate the unsearchable mysteries of God,
and to comprehend incomprehensibility.

I left this meeting in true joy of heart, and rejoiced in the Lord my gracious preserver,
who is learning me to depend on and attend to his _shuttings_ as well as his _openings:_
and this is the only way of safety.
In the afternoon I went to the Bank meeting, and had good open service,
and though in a short, I hope comfortable testimony to a living remnant present.
I attended the evening meeting at Market street.
It is a very large house, and was now greatly crowded.
I was quite silent, not feeling the least motion to speak a word among them.
There were several testimonies, and three appearances in prayer;
and I greatly fear some of those engaged in them are too easily drawn into words,
and not weighty enough in their spirits, nor deep enough in waiting.
Oh! the great injury done to the cause of Truth by offering unripe fruits.
My soul is grieved, and mourns over individuals, who might be useful in the church,
if self was fully slain, and never suffered to rise again into activity.

[.blurb]
=== Chewing the Cud, and Dividing the Hoof

I went to the select Quarterly meeting at Abington,
and sat through the same under great exercise, but near the close my way opened,
and I was enabled to press upon my brethren to keep to the
antitype of chewing the cud and dividing the hoof.
For nothing is fit for sacrifice to the Lord, that is contrary to this pattern.
And without great care, things may be offered in solemn sacrifice, which,
instead of being a sweet savour, may stink in His nostrils;
things may be handed forth in a very _undivided_ state, in the mixture,
light not _divided_ from darkness.
Oh! it is a great thing, rightly to _divide_ the word.
And for want of waiting for that which enables to do it,
there are many unskilful offerers, and unsanctified offerings;
like the unclean beasts under the law, which were not fit for sacrifice,
as wanting the _divided hoof,_ and the chewing of the cud.

Oh! this significant chewing of the cud,
how apt it is in representation of that turning of the fleece,
which is so necessary in a spiritual sense.
If things, presented to our minds for offering, in an undivided, undigested state,
were carefully kept, waited upon, and as it were, chewed and swallowed,
and chewed and swallowed again,
oh! how it would tend to clearness and thorough digestion: so that the offering might,
when rightly prepared, chewed, and divided be, like the clean beasts of old,
not only acceptable to the Lord, but profitable to the people.
But for want of waiting upon the opening, till things are rightly chewed, digested,
and divided, offerings are sometimes made of that which would die of itself:
and this is utterly forbidden, and unfit for sacrifice,
as being both a stink in the Lord`'s nostrils, and unwholesome food for the people.

[.blurb]
=== Lifeless Zeal

I was at Wilmington monthly Meeting and quite silent through the whole thereof;
it being a low time with me, though divers Friends seemed to be favoured.
Fifth-day, quite silent again at Kennet Monthly Meeting,
until towards the end of their business,
when I was concerned to point them to the life in the transaction of church affairs.
For they seemed very lifeless,
and handled those weighty matters too much in the
same manner as men do their outward business,
in the strength of mere creaturely faculties,
though some of them were very zealous of outside things, and very plain, which in itself,
is very well.
But my spirit was distressed with their want of divine warmth,
and also with their fulness of false zeal.

[.blurb]
=== Antichrist in the Temple

Here +++[+++at London Grove]
through laborious travail in the deeps,
life so far arose as to enable me to ease my mind in degree, though not fully,
of the very heavy exercise which has for some time distressed my mind,
under a sense of unsanctified self, and the busy, active, creaturely part,
having so much to do, in religious matters, even in some in whom it has once,
in good degree, been slain.
For, alas! the seemingly deadly wound has been healed in too many,
who might have been as silver trumpets in the Lord`'s hand: some as ministers,
and some in other services,
had self-activity been rightly kept down.

Oh! my soul hath deeply mourned over the loss our society sustains,
through Antichrist`'s thus sitting in the temple,
and usurping the place of the true teacher.
Many a poor soul, who too little thinks of being under the influence of Antichrist,
or even that Antichrist has any thing to do in our society, is so far governed thereby,
as under the influence thereof, to be building up Babel instead of Zion.
And this will more or less be the case, with all who attempt to build up Zion,
without the assistance of the true spirit of all Christian worship and discipline.
Oh! that these Babel-builders would see the confusion
of language which abounds among them,
however well connected their words and sentences may be in the letter.

[.blurb]
=== The Way Hedged up--Fasting

I was still shut up in their meeting for worship.
I cannot find that I have offended Him, or disobeyed Him;
I know not that I have run too fast, or lagged behind my Guide;
I have ardently endeavoured to do His will,
and to endure His dispensations patiently. Oh! that I may be preserved in patience,
and yet live to see His purpose in all these things.

My way is hedged up; I see no way to go forward.
Who can comprehend my desolate state?
or understand my mournful condition?
These reflections are excited in me.
I am a man of sorrow, and acquainted with grief! the light of God`'s countenance,
which I have often eminently felt,
and which I then prized and now desire above all other joys,
seems to be quite withholden from me, and nothing else in heaven,
nor in all the earth can satisfy my longing soul.
Lord! strengthen my patience that I murmur not,
after all that I have known of thy goodness: for I find daily bread is very desirable;
tasting and hunger are painful to nature:
but shall I follow Thee for the sake of the loaves?
or will it do to leave Thee in times of emptiness and abasement?

I now remember reading of the long fasting of Thy beloved Son,
and that at length he hungered.
Oh! then came the tempter, but he was defeated; for he _found nothing in_ that holy Lamb,
the Son of Thy bosom, that would receive any of his baits.
O my soul, may he find nothing in thee!
Thou hast often declared to others that the way of heaven is through
tribulation and sufferings! and now when they are come upon thee,
see to it, that thou keep the word of God`'s patience;
let patience have its perfect work,
lest _the end of the Lord`'s thus_ proving thee be frustrated;
for if all Satan`'s assaults be rightly resisted, and nothing of his offered food eaten,
thou mayst find yet relief and consolation.
And though it is now very distressing to drink thy Saviour`'s cup,
and be baptized with his baptism into suffering,
yet it must be endured or thou canst never sit with Him in his kingdom;
He has set thee an example that thou shouldst follow His steps.

[.blurb]
=== Perfect Through Suffering

And as it pleased God, in bringing many sons unto glory,
to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings:
so will His true follower be made perfect in like manner.

Therefore, O my drooping soul! trust in the Lord, for unto whom else canst thou go?
He only has the words of eternal life: and thou must not give back;
neither heights nor depths, things present, nor trials yet to come,
must separate thee from the love of God, nor from cleaving unto Him,
or thou wilt yet be undone forever.
For, until thou arrivest to this assurance,
that none of these things shall ever separate thee therefrom,
thou canst not say with thy suffering Lord, "`It is finished.`"
And this thou must yet be able to say in thy own experience, surely as He ever said it,
or thou wilt not be finally one of His friends and companions.
For, had not the way to eternal glory, been through tribulation,
and death to the old man, in every soul that is saved, Christ had never suffered;
but this being the only possible way, He graciously condescended and submitted to it;
being tempted, that He might succour those that are tempted; and passing through death,
that we might learn from His example, the necessity of dying with Him,
in order to arise with Him in newness of life.
For, "`where I am, there shall my servant be,`" in His unchangeable language,
to this day and forever.

And therefore, till all things in us are put under His feet,
and till He comes to rule and reign over all in us, whether pride, impatience,
or any thing whatever that is not conformable to His holy will;
He will find it necessary to fill up in us what remains yet behind of His sufferings.
For when anything contrary to a perfect subjection and obedience, prevails in us,
be it the least murmur, distrust, or whatever it may be,
He cannot at that time reign unrivalled in us; but is under suffering,
and pressed as a cart with sheaves.
Here we must learn patiently to suffer with Him,
till all things in us be put in subjection to Him,
or we can never fully reign with Him in uninterrupted glory and happiness.
For, until all this is done in us, Christ will still to us, as individuals,
be held to and remain in His mediatorial office and character; not being in a capacity,
as to us, and as to His state of depression in us,
to render up the kingdom to His Father;
seeing God is not yet so fully become our all in all,
as that we have no wish or will in us contrary to His holy will concerning us.

I am now as fully confirmed, that this must be the case with every soul, before,
or whenever complete redemption and salvation are witnessed by him;
as I am that God ever was, or now is, in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.
And moreover I am as well assured that God is still, and ever will be in Christ,
carrying on the same work of reconciliation, where it is submitted to,
till all the sons of Adam receive their final sentence "`Come, ye blessed,`" or "`Go,
ye cursed,`" and are arranged, either as sheep on the right hand,
and received with the righteous into life eternal, or as goats, on the left hand,
and sent away into everlasting punishment, as I am that He ever was, at any time,
thus in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.
And indeed, I am fully satisfied of both.
Yea, I might go further and add, that as sure as God was, or is in Christ;
So sure is Christ in man, reconciling poor sinners to Himself,
through the death of the cross.
And it is utterly vain to hope for salvation in any other way,
than through death with Christ, to every sinful motion.
It is, and it was, and it ever will be, through suffering and death, to the first nature,
that salvation must be known.

This is the mystery of the sufferings, and of the fellowship of the sufferings of Christ.
Some may call me an heretic when I confess unto them,
that I expect no final benefit from the death of Jesus,
in any other way than through fellowship with Him in His sufferings.
But after the way which they call heresy, worship I the God of my fathers,
truly believing in the history of Christ`'s life, death, resurrection, ascension,
and glory; and desiring more and more to "`know Him,
and the fellowship of His sufferings,`" and to be made, not in part only,
but fully "`conformable to His death;`" that I may like Him, and with Him,
be put to death in the flesh, but quickened in and by the Spirit.
For I quite despair of heaven, on any other terms.

I read this in all the works and operations of nature.
I read it plainly in the law.
I read it plainer in the gospel.
And I read the beginnings, and a good progression thereof,
plainest of all in the inward experience of my own exercised soul. In natural things,
the wheat must fall into the earth and _die,_ or it will never bring forth fruit.
In the law, without blood there was no remission.
Death was, even in the figure, necessary in order to atonement for sin.
The firstling of the flock, was then called for.
The very _life_ of the firstling was taken away, as typical of our sinful life,
in the _first_ nature; for, as says the Apostle, "`that was not first which is spiritual,
but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.`"
Moreover the burnt offerings, sacrifices made by _fire,_ as a sweet savour to the Lord,
how clearly they point out the Lord`'s refining furnace, and His powerful _burnings_ in us,
as an oven, against all pride, and all in us that does wickedly, in any way or degree!

In the gospel dispensation, this doctrine shines forth with divine brightness,
in all the sufferings, and agonizing tribulations, the vinegar and gall,
and the finally patient death of Jesus Christ, on the cross:
and in the plentiful testimony in the New Testament
that what remains behind of His sufferings,
must be filled up in His body, the Church; that if we die with Him, we shall live;
if we suffer with Him, we shall reign with Him; if we save our life, we shall lose it;
if we lose it for His sake we shall find it: in that Paul _died daily,_
and desired to _know nothing,_ but _Jesus Christ,_ and _him crucified;_
and to know his old man crucified, with all the affections and lusts.
And abundance more might be mentioned,; much of which,
I perhaps should never have understood,
had not the Lord my God led me through many lessons of experience,
in the substance of them in my own soul.

Oh! that a perfect death may come upon everything in me, which is contrary to that life,
that is "`hid with Christ in God;`" that where He is, I may be also;
a living witness that though He was dead, yet He is alive, and liveth forevermore;
and that, because He liveth, I live also;
feeling and knowing that whosoever truly believeth in Him, though he were dead,
yet shall he live: and will live, reign, and triumph with Him, over death, hell,
and the grave, forever.
Amen.

=== Silent in Meetings for 20 Days

Here +++[+++New Garden]
the power of the Word of Life was renewed in me,
in such a manner that I seemed to myself in some sort as if I had risen from the dead.
Oh how clearly, and beyond all doubt, am I satisfied in my own mind,
that it is nothing else than the power of an endless Life that again quickened
me and raised me up in a living testimony among my brethren in this meeting.
For twenty days past,
I have not dared to open my mouth in one of the public
meetings for worship that I have attended:
I have been at fifteen.
Doubtless, if I would have been presumptuous,
I could have stood up and delivered words in plenty of them.
I felt sensibly that I of myself could no more open anything divine,
than a corrupt fountain can send forth sweet and wholesome waters.
I found I could not move forward in word and testimony,
to any kind of profit to the people or to my own peace,
while the cloud rested on the tabernacle.
My business was to keep silence before the Lord in abasement,
and as much as possible in patience; and, blessed be His Name,
He was pleased to appear again, to my comfort and enlargement,
as well as to the comfort of many others then present.

There is not more difference between midnight darkness,
and the bright shining of the meridian sun,
than between the state of mind in some of these late meetings,
and my present enlargement and illumination.
_Before_ all was so shut up, that none could open: but now all seems to be so open,
as that no man can shut.
Glory, honour, and praise, to Him who leadeth me in the path of this blessed experience.
I can now bless His holy hand, both in His shutting and in His opening,
and rejoice with joy unspeakable, that I have learned this experience,
and this dependence on Him alone.

Oh! that multitudes of talkers would come out of themselves,
and learn of Him in whom all fulness dwells,
and in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,
even so shut up and hid in Him, that we can never have, or know them,
but only as He opens them to us.

[.blurb]
=== Ineffable Communion

We were at Wilmington, where I had been, and suffered in silence, some time past.
Notice being now given of our intention of being here, it was a large crowded meeting,
and the doctrines of Truth were opened in my mind in great clearness,
and utterance being graciously afforded, it was indeed a highly favoured day.
I could write much of this heavenly meeting, but all centres in the mercy, favour,
and lovingkindness of the Lord,
without whom we are altogether helpless and cannot move to profit.
Oh! how comfortable! how unspeakably consolating it is to our souls,
when we are admitted within the veil,
and swallowed up in the luminous presence of our God!
This is truly __"`joy unspeakable and full of glory;`"__ a blessed
and ineffable communion! a transporting earnest,
or foretaste of the joys to come.
Oh! that all mankind would believe in and press after these divine enjoyments,
this heavenly participation of the love of God,
which neither tongue nor pen is able to set forth to the full.
But, alas! too many are faithless and unbelieving,
ready to think this is all imagination and enthusiasm.
But, oh! if they could come to the blessed enjoyment, their doubts would soon vanish,
and their souls would be established in a blessed confirmation, as on the Rock of ages,;
and anchored in a living trust and confidence in God,
and a lively hope of everlasting life.

[.blurb]
=== No True Gospel Ministry without Inspiration

At this meeting I had to bear testimony to the continuation of divine inspiration,
and that there can be no true gospel ministry without it:
that those whose hour is always come, or who are always ready,
however they may work themselves up, heat and warm themselves and others,
by the sparks of their own kindling, and, like the priests or prophets of Baal,
be ever so vehement, yet can they never, without divine inspiration and assistance,
profit the people.

But that those who wait for, and move only in this,
will always in a greater or less degree,
reach the witness of Truth in the hearts of the people.
Their words will be attended with a lively savour, far beyond the mere sound of voice,
even though,
(as the natural understanding and bodily organs are made use of
to express the prospects and openings of the mind,) they may not
always deliver themselves with strict accuracy and propriety.
But as their sense and meaning are felt, and attended to by the hearers,
it is perceived to be with authority, and not as the scribes, that they speak.

Though I knew not there were any teachers of that sort who are always ready,
in the meeting, I afterwards heard that there were several Baptist preachers present,
who do not even profess to wait for divine aid in their preaching to the people,
but appoint a time, and fall to speaking, etc.

Thus the Lord enabled me, as I waited for His openings,
to bear pertinent testimony against such as wait not for His influence, but run,
and He hath not sent them.
Oh! it is good to keep close to the divine opening, and to be or do nothing without it;
nor yet afraid to move in it, and declare faithfully what is opened,
and commission given to utter, leaving the service and event to the Lord.

[.blurb]
=== Better Days to Come

We were at Chester Monthly Meeting, held at Providence, where,
in the meeting for worship, I had very searching service,
yet dropping a word of comfort and encouragement to an exercised seed among them.
It was on the whole a good meeting.
Third-day, 26th, we had a good meeting at Springfield.
Fourth-day, 27th, another at Middleton; precious also, especially the last,
wherein truth rose into dominion, and its doctrines were livingly and largely opened:
a sifting time spoken of; better days or more reformed to succeed:
and a more general spreading of the truth among the nations, to the effecting in time,
a cessation of wars, and the downfall of priestcraft.

[.blurb]
=== Move Only in the Clearness--A Caution

Now, though this was an high day indeed,
and God`'s holy help and presence eminently enjoyed, yet I feel most easy to mention,
that near the end of the meeting, feeling (as I thought,
under a good degree of religious weight), the Spirit of supplication, I kneeled,
and presented my petition and intercessions to the Lord:
but had very little true peace in so doing.
For the meeting having sat long, and I being unwilling to detain it unseasonably,
kneeled too soon;
and it may be that I stepped into the service of some other exercised instrument.
For I am convinced that there is such a thing, as to have so much feeling sense of,
and sympathy with another`'s exercise, as to make great caution necessary,
lest we move in each other`'s commission, without a real commission of our own.

I am willing to leave it as a caution, though to my own condemnation,
(and may self ever be condemned,) that thou, O favoured instrument, whoever thou art,
mayst be continually on thy watch, especially when thou hast been highly favoured,
lest thou move again, either in an additional testimony or in supplication,
merely in that fulness of divine aboundings,
and in the overflowings of that cup of heavenly blessing,
given thee in order to abilitate thee for the service already performed, or, afterward,
a reward for thy faithfulness therein.

For this thou mayst be in danger of doing, even without a real commission,
unless thou art very careful.
Or, thou mayst feel thy spirit dipped into a near sympathy with
the exercise of another who is under the qualifying hand,
and just ready to move in the strength and clearness of a right commission.
And if thou art not strictly careful to wait for a clear opening,
thou mayst move in a feeling of another`'s exercise, to thy own hurt,
the hurt of that other instrument who was receiving the commission,
and even to the great hurt of the whole meeting.
And in thy missing thy way, and running before thy guide, in any of those ways,
either in prayer or public testimony, thou wilt retard thy own progress in the right way,
and bring darkness over thy mind.
But if thou art always careful to wait for a right commission,
and never to move without it, thou wilt never thus err from the right way,
but wilt surely be preserved.

[.blurb]
=== Eminent Aboundings

We had a good meeting at Newtown, where I had been before in silence.
O Lord my God! how good thou art to my soul!
How wonderfully, and beyond my expectation,
thou continuest to replenish me with the eminent aboundings of Thy love;
and causest my cup indeed to overflow.
How do I feel the incomes of thy heart-consolating presence,
even as I ride on the way from meeting to meeting. Oh! how abundantly
are all my by-past abasement and strippings made up,
and much more than simply overbalanced,
by the aboundings which I now enjoy from day to day!
Truly, the way to abound, is first to be abased: and the only way to reign with Christ,
is to suffer with Him.
O my God!
I bless Thy holy Name, for all Thy benefits.
Thou makest me to rejoice and sing.
Thou fillest my soul with goodness, my bones with marrow and fatness, spiritually.
And I have at divers favoured seasons, for many days past, seen much of Thy goodness.
Very extraordinary have been Thy divine communications to my soul, opening after opening,
from one meeting to another, in great clearness,
and with strength and utterance to my own admiration.

It is doubtless for the sake of the people, who stand in need of instruction, reproof,
or encouragement, which livingly and plentifully flowed forth unto them this day,
as at divers other times in my late travels.
The doctrine of the light, grace, and Spirit of God;
the universality and sufficiency thereof, for the salvation of all men:
the nature of true saving faith, as partaking of the very evidence of things hoped for;
the entire sufficiency of the one cessation of John`'s,
as to any obligation or use upon Christians now; and the nature of true gospel ministry,
as being an efficacious, feeling, baptizing ministry;
all these doctrines have been very clearly opened in truth`'s only saving baptism;
the pure authority.

[.blurb]
=== Great Deviations and Entanglements among the Called

Great is the deviation from true christian humility, inward watchfulness,
and ardency of spirit, as also from true plainness in dress, building, furniture, etc.,
among too many in this large city +++[+++Philadelphia]; and leanness, weakness,
and want of true magnanimity in the cause of Christ, prevail in proportion.
Oh! how many there are, who, if they would submit to the Cross,
would soon become valiants in Israel, who now, through shunning it,
are stumbling at the threshold, and remain dwarfish, and,
in great degree useless in their day and generation.

My spirit mourns over them,
with ardent wishes that they may lift up their heads above the world, and all its frowns,
friendships, and entanglements;
that they may thus rise into the liberty of the sons of God,
and feel the truth to make them free indeed.
For now they are held in bondage, and at some time, when they feel their thraldom,
they do really groan under it, and for a moment, pant for deliverance,
and wish a releasement from their bonds and imprisonment.
But, alas! they soon sink back again into the old captivating conformity and compliance.
Thus many grovel on through life, and never know what it is to be free,
nor to enjoy the sweets of true Christian liberty.
May the young and rising generation shun that rock, the spirit of the world,
on which so many have been shipwrecked.
I am clear in it, that there is a precious seed among them, who, if faithful,
will shine forth in greater lustre and purity than
many of those who have gone before them.
O Lord!
I pray Thee, hold them in Thy holy hand.

[.blurb]
=== Bitterness of Soul

After I got home from Pennsylvania,
I travelled through many heights and depths in my own mind for a considerable time,
and seemed to be the nearest losing all faith and hope in God,
that I ever remembered to have experienced.
Oh! none knows, but the Lord alone,
the fulness of that bitterness of soul which I had to endure!
It was beyond all trials I ever had known,
and through which I did not always abide sufficiently on the watch-tower,
in strict patience, resignation, and confidence in Him who never yet has failed me,
when I have rightly trusted in Him; but when I have thrown aside my shield,
and lost sight of my armour, O my soul,
thou only art fully sensible of the darkness and
desolation into which thou hast been plunged!
But magnified over all, forever, be the great name of the Lord, He did not leave me,
nor forsake me; but,
after pouring out into my cup large draughts of wormwood mingled with gall,
was graciously pleased, (having thus reduced my soul, for the present at least,
to perfect resignation,) to lift up the light of His countenance upon me,
in a marvellous and heart-consolating manner.

[.blurb]
=== Fresh Call to Service

+++[+++1788]
Having thus passed through some very trying seasons, and also,
through the marvellous goodness of God, experienced many precious renewings of His love,
to the refreshment of my drooping spirit,
the Lord was pleased to lay it upon me to make a
visit to Friends and others in the southern States;
to sympathise with the suffering seed, and endeavour, as ability might be given,
to stir up the pure mind in my fellow-men,
by persuading them to seek an increasing acquaintance with God,
the only source of all sure consolation.

This requisition I was loth to give up to,
and seemed furnished with divers objections thereto, First,
I knew my own great unworthiness; and therefore,
thought there must be an unfitness in the same proportion.
But the answer was, "`Depend on Me entirely, to fit and qualify thee from day to day.
Have no might of thy own.
Attend to my direction in all things.
Wait on me for ability, and thou shalt never find Me wanting,
to supply thee sufficiently, for the service I shall require of thee,
on every occasion.`"
I knew His promise never yet had failed me; and I durst not now distrust Him.

And yet so weak was I, that for several months,
l was exceedingly tried with fears about a subsistence for my family;
for although I could ever say in that respect, as in spiritual things,
hitherto the Lord hath helped us; yet it often looked almost impossible to me,
that they should be, in any comfortable degree provided for,
if I gave up to be so much of my time from home, and out of business,
unless my friends helped to support them: and to that I felt a great unwillingness,
on many accounts.
I felt unworthy of their assistance.
I feared it would not be to the honour of Truth, for me to be abroad in Truth`'s service,
and my family a burden to Truth`'s friends at home, and many other reasonings,
and trying considerations; but the holy injunction was so often and so clearly repeated,
that I dare not refuse obedience to it, let what would,
or possibly could be the consequence of my submission.
I was shown, that if I refused and stayed at home in my business,
I should not be able to "`add one cubit to my stature`";
but that blasting would attend me; a curse, instead of a blessing; yea,
that I should become a burden to myself, and an annoyance to my dear wife,
and tender offspring.
But on the other hand, if I gave up, and faithfully followed the Lord`'s holy leadings,
in all things, He would be with me and never forsake me.
Yea, He gave me a full assurance,
that neither I nor the family should want for food convenient,
or other necessaries of life.
So, after many and various conflicts, my soul bowed before Him;
and in a view of His omnipotence, omniscience, and unbounded goodness,
I was enabled to give up all, and casting my care upon Him,
in regard to temporals and spirituals, I said in my heart, "`Here am I Lord, send me;
send me, O holy Father, wherever Thou pleasest:
I refuse not to follow Thee into any corner of the earth, only do Thou go with me,
and support My life, my strength, and the length of my days, I devote to Thy service;
my family I resign to Thy holy care and keeping; to Thee I dedicate them.
Oh! mayst Thou watch over and preserve them!
Preserve them in Thy favour,
and bring them into a near and intimate acquaintance with Thy love,
with Thy powerful and life-giving presence.
Take my dear wife as into Thy bosom; my infants,
oh! preserve and hold them fast forever.`"

At this surrender of all things, I felt the light of heaven to fill my soul;
it shined in me and round about me, above the brightness of the sun indeed,
and opened my prospects into distant nations,
with some belief that the Lord was opening a large
field of labour for me in foreign countries,
to be entered into in His own due season.
I said, "`Good is Thy will, O Lord! dispose of me, Thy unworthy servant,
as Thou pleasest.`"

[.blurb]
=== Loses Sense of the Call

And having obtained a certificate of the concurrence of the Monthly Meeting,
it was carried to the Quarterly Meeting in the first month 1789;
and there the Lord was pleased to fill my soul with strength
and gave utterance to my weight of exercise and concern,
to the greatly tendering of my own heart and the hearts of my brethren and sisters.
I opened it both in the men`'s and women`'s meeting,
and received a certificate of their concurrence with my concern,
their near sympathy with me under the exercise attending it,
and their prayers for my preservation through every
baptism and trial that I might meet with.
Being thus furnished, the Lord was pleased to strip me further,
even to the loss of all sense of duty in regard to the journey.
Sometimes I was ready to think I should never see the way to move forward.
To this trial I submitted, saying in my mind, "`Lord, lay on me whatever Thou pleasest,
and when I murmur or complain, add more.
I submit to any thing that shall end with time, only preserve my soul,
and give me a mansion hereafter in Thy presence.
The cup Thou offerest me, however mingled with wormwood and gall,
and how long soever continued, I`'l embrace and partake of as offered grace.
I am Thine.
Do with me according to Thy own good pleasure, all the days of my pilgrimage here below.`"

Thus I passed on for a considerable season, in much exercise,
and seeming desertion.
Yet my faith was firm in the arm of divine sufficiency,
at almost all moments throughout the whole of this last mentioned fiery trial;
and it wrought in me, not only great abasement, but great refinement and confirmation.
I had nearly always, under this exercise, however shaken before,
an unshaken evidence and assurance,
that whether I ever found my way opened again here on earth,
and among the saints below or not, I should certainly, if I held on my way,
find it opened in songs of never-ending hallelujahs among angels and archangels,
cherubim and seraphim, in the habitations of glory hereafter.
And herein my soul was made contented,
and a willingness wrought in me to do and suffer whatever the Lord pleased.
Yea, at length, I felt perfectly resigned,
not only to anything that could possibly befall me here below, but hereafter also;
for I felt and knew,
even in the extremity of distress and almost total seeming desolation,
that my God could not deny His own; that however unworthy, I was married to Him;
and that unless I adulterated from Him, He would never put me away.
I also felt all His chastisements to be in mercy,
and His seeming desertion to be for my further qualification.
I kissed the rod, and adored Him who had appointed it,
and thus patiently waited His further direction.

[.blurb]
=== Unreserved Submission

Alas! alas!
I find an entire insufficiency in the force of words,
to convey an adequate idea of the heartfelt pangs which I have purchased,
through the want of close attention to that which never once has failed me,
when I have carefully relied upon and diligently attended to it.
But magnified forever be the great Name of the Lord!
He left not my soul in the pit,
nor suffered the powers of darkness to maintain dominion over me.
He brought me out from the prison-house, redeemed me from the darkest dungeon,
and again and again wrought deliverance for me; filling my mouth with songs of joy,
my soul with hallelujahs!
Praise the Lord, O my soul, forever and ever.
Exalt Him, all ye who ever felt the riches of His mercy,
the unspeakable glory of His pardoning love,
and the wisdom of His dealings with poor mankind.
He knows how to turn His hand upon man.
He can abase his soul in depths of misery,
and bring him forth again with shouts of heartfelt praises.

I have known His wonders in the wilderness.
I have seen them in the depths, and often wondered at the wisdom of His dispensations.
Eye hath not seen, the ear of carnal man has not heard,
nor the hearts of unconverted mortals ever conceived the
half of what He works and brings about for Jacob`'s tribulated,
wrestling seed.
My life is laid at His feet.
My body, soul, and spirit are with unreserved submission offered up before Him.
Do what Thou wilt with me; lay what Thou pleasest upon me, O Lord God of my life!
I dedicate my all, my life, and the length of my days, to Thy service,
a free-will offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto Thee, O my God.
And if Thou shalt call me before the Pope of Rome, or any other persecuting power,
to lay down my life for the good of Thy militant church, I refuse it not.
I acknowledge Thy absolute right to the entire disposal of me;
nor shall anything that shall end with time be too much for me to do, or to suffer,
for Thy precious truth.
I am wholly Thine by creation.
I am doubly Thine by redemption.
Only be Thou with me, only do Thou enable me,
and I will comply with aught Thy wisdom shall direct.
My life is not dear to me.
My own will, my own choice, my own inclinations, I utterly renounce;
and in an awful and abasing sense of my own entire inability,
and of my proneness to revolt, and in full dependence on Thee alone,
I hereby covenant and engage to serve Thee forever;
follow Thee wheresoever Thou leadest me; to bear Thy testimony through all nations,
if Thy will be so;
and to seal it with my blood in any part of Thy inhabited earth that Thou shalt order.
Amen, amen, saith the soul of Thy poor unworthy and unprofitable servant.

=== Preservation of the Ministry

+++[+++Philadelphia, 1789]
In the select meeting, which was large and solemn,
I was constrained to express my having been dipped into deep exercise and concern,
that the ministry might be preserved on its right foundation;
that none might feel any degree of an independent sufficiency for that work and service,
nor give way to any creaturely activity therein, nor attempt to add to,
adorn or embellish, what Truth might open; but that all might keep to the opening,
in the strictest simplicity; for that the _smooth_ stone out of the _running_ stream,
will not fail to do the necessary execution;
when all the seemingly mighty armour of Saul will fail.
Oh! the travail and depth of engagement, which I felt!
How ardently I wished everything plucked up by the roots,
that had any might or sufficiency, beside that which is immediately of God;
that every stone in every building, which is not of Him, might be thrown down,
till there might not be left one stone upon another!
Truth mightily assisted me,
and its precious testimony had a powerful reach on the minds of many present.
Blessed be the Name of the Lord.

In the public meetings also, and in the Monthly Meetings,
our way was opened with admirable clearness, strength, and authority.
A watering season it was indeed, for most of the week, in this favoured city.
Many important truths were opened, and much labour bestowed,
in regard to divers branches of our religious testimony.
May the Lord bless them with a happy increase, in the purity and way of truth.
I was abundantly confirmed that I was rightly directed
in the proper timing of my visit to this place.
Let the Lord have all the glory.
I know the praise is wholly due to Him,
and am deeply sensible that the favours witnessed
and received at this precious and soul reviving season,
were in consequence of a deep felt dependence on Him alone,
and a good degree of thorough renunciation of all separate ability.
And this will remain to be the way to witness the greatest degrees of divine help:
for the Lord will not fail His truly dependent children, His poor in spirit,
His helpless babes whose cry is to, and whose dependence is wholly on Him for help.

[.blurb]
=== The Total Loss of All Things

But alas! the want of this _total loss of all things_ of our own,
often greatly hurts our religious meetings; mars their beauty;
prevents the overshadowing of the cherubim of glory: and instead thereof,
brings forth a mixture, a Babylonish confusion of languages, a linsey-woolsey garment.
And though some who are active in thus turning away,
or preventing the fulness of that transcendent glory, which might be known,
may be ready to think, (as they seem often much animated), that they have done bravely,
and been favoured; yet, the little, low, meek, innocent seed is often, under all this,
abased in suffering silence.
And if these seeming champions themselves, were to get low enough,
and inquire deeply enough of the true oracle--the unflattering Witness in themselves,
they would sometimes find, that the plant of renown,
of the Lord`'s own right hand planting, was rather depressed than nourished,
even in their own souls, by these their animated exertions.

For nothing quickens Life, but Life; nothing rejoiceth in the Truth,
but what through sufferings, is united with Him that was made perfect through sufferings;
and nothing can beget to God, but what is of and from Him.
A few gentle steps in the life, a few deliberate expressions in the clearness,
even under great depression, relieves the suffering seed,
far more than the most animated and lengthy testimony in the mixture.
Yea, the one relieves, whilst the other oppresses.
Therefore let all concerned come into the clearness, stand as trumpets,
through which Truth may speak to the people.
And above all things +++[+++let such]
beware of that which maketh haste; not only before beginning to speak,
but even through the whole course of their testimony.
Wait low, move gently, rise only as Truth, the pure unmixed truth, arises;
and then the seed will be relieved, the souls of the thirsty watered,
and Judgment will be placed where it ever ought to be.

We left Philadelphia, on sixth day the 27th,
and were next day at a select meeting at Wilmington, and on first and second days,
at their general meeting for worship there, where Truth gave us the Victory,
and afforded ability to exalt the precious testimony thereof,
though through deep sufferings in spirit.

But as we kept in patience under sufferings, we found Him with us therein,
whom neither death nor the grave could hold or confine; and in His resurrection,
we were made to reign with Him.
After this we had meetings at Christiana Bridge, and the Head of Elk,
among people mostly not of our society.
But though I felt a strong opposition in some minds at the last place,
yet truth gave the victory at both these meetings;
the last being eminently owned by the overshadowing of divine life,
in the power and demonstration whereof, the everlasting gospel was preached among them;
may it fasten "`as a nail in a sure place.`"

=== Ministers Shut up--Undue Expectations

I believe there may be various causes why the Lord`'s messengers are sometimes shut up,
either in suffering, or in quiet, comfortable silence.
I am ready to believe this is in wisdom ordered, at times, much for their own trial,
experience, and further qualification.
Sometimes, perhaps, they may be in too much haste to get forward,
and to finish their journey sooner than would be best, and most useful.
In such case their being thus shut up,
may help to bring them to a deeper attention to the clear pointings of that finger,
which not only points where, but when to go.
For much depends on embracing the right time,
and great care is necessary not to run too fast, nor go too slow.
And herein divine wisdom will ever be ready profitably to direct all,
who patiently and carefully wait for its direction.

Another cause why such as are rightly called into service,
in places quite out of their knowledge, as to the state of meetings and individuals,
may be shut up from words, I believe is, often, the undue expectations of the people.
I often think great numbers of people, Friends as well as others,
have their eye and expectation too much to the poor ministers,
and here the Lord is pleased sometimes to disappoint them,
for "`He will not give His glory to another.`"
The ministers, if they are His, have nothing at all at their own command, or disposal,
that they can offer to the people; and the Almighty,
from whom all true ministry must proceed, sees it to be much more profitable at times,
to withhold His communications, than to afford them through instruments,
in order to turn the attention of the people to Himself,
and teach them not to be too much looking to man.
Oh! the pain and deep distress,
which this outward expectation in the people often
brings upon the deeply exercised ministers,
whose attention is inward, and who dare not offer strange fire or strange offerings,
but are bowed to the root; waiting for an offering of the Lord`'s preparing,
either to be offered up in the inward silence of their own souls,
or vocally among the people, as the Lord shall order.

I have often wondered that Friends, who ought to know and do better,
should so generally give way to such an unjustifiable expectation and dependence;
for I believe that their so doing, and neglecting a humble, reverent waiting on God,
has prevented both their immediate and instrumental instruction and consolation,
and caused barrenness and death to reign from the
beginning to the end of many of our religious meetings.
Indeed, I believe the Lord beholds this species of idolatry,
(for such it surely is,) with as great disapprobation
as He does many other kinds of idolatry in the world,
which many Friends, and others, who are deeply guilty in this,
would almost shudder at the thought of being guilty of.
Oh! that they rightly saw and felt the loss they sustain, by this their egregious folly.

I am also deeply sensible, and fully satisfied,
that the Lord`'s faithful messengers are sometimes shut up from outward communication,
as an example and check to such as have got too much into a course of preaching,
without properly waiting for, and knowing, a sufficient commission and qualification,
from time to time.
And this being both a very dangerous situation to themselves,
and very pernicious to those among whom they thus minister, the watchful,
gracious Shepherd of the sheep, is often pleased to lead His real, living ministers,
who know His voice, and will faithfully follow Him, and not another,
into deep and exemplary silence,
for the benefit and instruction of such forward preachers.
Some of these, though thus entangled, may be, in good degree,
rightly disposed and well-meaning; and it is to be hoped that such will receive instruction,
and come to a right establishment on the alone sure foundation;
and thus be preserved from attempting to build thereon, either with gold or silver, wood,
hay, or stubble, or any thing else, but what and as the Lord shall direct and abilitate.
Then will their building stand sure, through all storms and tempests;
nor shall the very gates of hell prevail against it.

[.blurb]
=== An Appearance of the Glory

This night, as I lay awake in bed,
I was almost overcome with the fresh extendings of
the love and goodness of God to my soul,
and seemed swallowed up in the inshinings of His luminous and glorious presence.
In this almost ecstatic enjoyment, my soul bowed in awfulness and reverence before Him,
and the whole man was renewedly offered up to His service,
to be disposed of as He pleased.
And after thus continuing for some time, subjectly given up to His holy will,
witnessing His glory to rest upon me as a royal diadem,
and receiving some sweet manifestations or confirmations of His
fatherly care having been day and night extended to and over me,
from my youth, for my preservation and advancement in the way of life and salvation,
it pleased His infinite majesty to condescend once more, (as at some few gracious,
solemn, and peculiar seasons, in the course of my pilgrimage before,) as it were,
set open the windows of heaven,
and spread before the view of my mind the excellency and glory thereof.

And which above all rejoiced my soul, He also set open the arms of His mercy:
showing me and giving me feelingly to know, that although,
at many times in the course of my life,
I had not so kept under a sense of His preserving
influence as to shun the snares of the enemy,
but had sometimes been entangled in them, yet there was nothing retained against me;
but that all was freely remitted and washed away in the blood of the Lamb;
and that if I henceforth stood firm in obedience to Him,
and in the promotion of His cause, as ability was given,
I should reign with Him in glory, world without end.
I found myself clothed inwardly, as it were, with clean white linen.
I saw that my garments had, in days past, been much defiled,
but were now washed and made clean.

I saw that I had indeed come thus far "`through great tribulation,`" and that,
had I not submitted thereto,
I must have remained "`filthy still,`" My very soul bowed
in deepest prostration before the throne of God,
my cry ascended for future preservation, and I vowed continued obedience,
through His help, to the end of my stay here in this vale of tears.
My heart was lifted up in songs of praise for the wonders of His love to me-ward;
and I had to contemplate and adore the unmerited kindness
and goodness of His gracious dealings with me;
I could say He had plucked my feet out of the mire and clay, and set them upon a rock;
in good degree established my goings, and put a "`__new song__ in my mouth,
even praises to my God.`"

O Lord! hold me fast forever.
Keep my soul alive to the end.
Make of me, and do with me what and as Thou pleasest.
I am Thine; this is my rejoicing: I wish ever to remain Thine; and if ever my own will,
my own corrupt inclinations, presume to rend me from Thee,
O my gracious Father! be Thou pleased to interpose,
and to lift up a standard against all that may rise up against me for evil.
I dare not depend on my own strength or resolutions,
but must look unto thee to strengthen me in weakness, and to make effectual my strivings,
wrestlings, and resolutions against sin.
I commit myself wholly to Thy care and keeping; be Thou my light and my leader,
and hold me in Thy holy hand forever.
Amen.
Amen.

[.blurb]
=== Methodists

Next day we had a glorious meeting at this place, at Friends`' meetinghouse,
but mostly among such as were not Friends, many of them being called Methodists,
a people that abound in this land;
and some of their hearts have been touched with a live coal from the holy altar;
but they seemed very unsettled, many having hurried forward into much religious activity,
being very noisy, talkative, and almost, if not quite ranting.
Yet I hope some of them will come to a settlement in the truth;
but expect many will run quite out, and finally shake off their religious exercise:
this being the natural consequence of making haste into religious
performances without the pure leadings of truth therein.
My heart and mouth were largely opened among them in this and divers other meetings;
and this day, in a special manner, the streams of life flowed plentifully and sweetly,
to my great satisfaction and comfort, and to the refreshment of many minds.
Glory to God, Who hath hitherto helped us!
We can do nothing without His help,
but can do all things required of us through His strengthening influence in and upon us.

[.blurb]
=== Slavery and Idleness

We had precious meetings at Herring-Creek and Bush River, mostly among other people,
as Methodists, etc., though at Friends`' meetinghouses;
for Friends at these places are few in number.
There used to be many valuable Friends belonging to these meetings.
We were very clear in our judgment,
that Friends having formerly kept such numbers of slaves,
did much contribute to the ruin of their posterity:
for the poor negroes were put to do nearly all the work,
while the children of Friends were brought up in "`pride, fulness of bread,
and abundance of idleness,`" riding about for pleasure, living at ease and in fulness.
This was productive of many evils,
and opened a wide door for unprofitable and pernicious intimacy with hurtful company,
until,
alas! the youth in some particular places are almost all departed from the way of Truth,
and an almost total desolation reigns in some places in this land.
Oh! the mischiefs of idleness and oppression!
May it be the special care of all religious people
strictly to bring up their children to some honest,
industrious, and useful employment.
I believe Truth requires it,
that a blessing attends it and that much evil is prevented by it.
My spirit deeply mourns over the sorrowful and dangerous situation of such who have,
as they say,
"`nothing to do;`" believing they will almost certainly "`soon learn to do evil.`"

[.blurb]
=== A Gospel Minister Has Nothing of His Own

We rode forty-five miles to Stafford +++[+++Virginia]
and had a dull meeting there the day following: it was silent,
except a few words at the close, which I felt easy to drop with my hat on,
informing that the life was so low, and the springs so shut up,
that I had not dared to attempt any thing under pretence of preaching the gospel;
but that I felt a particular freedom to mention something
that had turned in my mind to those not of our society.

I told them, a minister of the gospel had nothing of his own to offer to the people:
his whole dependance is on Christ: he must speak as the oracle of God,
and only in the ability that God giveth;
therefore is under an absolute necessity to keep silence,
unless immediately commissioned and abilitated from God; that, for their sakes,
through the flowings of the love which I felt to them,
I had rather desired as a creature, that the way might be opened for communication;
but that I found a flow of love and good will was
not a sufficient qualification to preach the gospel;
mentioning that Saul`'s forcing himself and offering,
through a fear that the people would be scattered abroad, displeased the Lord,
and Samuel his prophet;
that therefore I had not dared to attempt to preach the gospel among them,
knowing who it was that said,
such as kindle a fire and warm themselves by the sparks of their own kindling,
shall lie down in sorrow.

I further told them, that those who can appoint meetings when they please,
and always preach in them, whether divinely influenced or not, whatever they may pretend,
are not ministers of Christ; they have something of their own,
and are not wholly dependent on Him.
Such preachers, however well they mean, and though even sometimes favoured,
for the people`'s sakes, yet if they go that independent manner,
almost universally run themselves into a flat, lifeless, formality,
and dry up what little spring of Life they may once have felt.

[.blurb]
=== Christ`'s Agony

I remembered the account of Christ`'s agony, His sweating as it were drops of blood,
and crying out to His heavenly Father, "`My God! my God! why hast Thou forsaken me?`"

I saw the propriety of His passing through this trying scene,
and I believed it necessary for me to go through that portion of
sufferings assigned me though He passed through His for our sakes;
He being experimentally touched with a feeling of our infirmities and sufferings.
Not but that His omniscience as God could see and
behold it all without feeling it in a body of flesh;
but as the brethren were partakers of flesh and blood,
He willingly took part of the same,
and in all the sufferings incident to the brethren in this life,
therein to set us an example of faith, patience, and divine preservation through all.
And that He might both feel and manifest this resignation
in the most conspicuous manner possible,
He was so far stripped as to feel as if He was forsaken; yet even in this extremity,
though, as a man, He was ready to wish the cup to pass from Him,
yet He centered in "`not My will but Thine be done.`"

I saw that there was no way for me to get rightly along, but through the same submission;
and this afternoon every painful impression was removed,
and the light of Life shined into my soul with un- clouded clearness:
I was let at liberty, and judgment was indeed brought forth unto victory.

[.blurb]
=== Ministry--Creaturely Activity

Had a meeting at Cedar Creek; not painful, nor yet had I much enjoyment;
but was quite shut up as to words in the ministry;
yet had an engagement to inform the people, at the conclusion of the meeting,
of the sorrow I often had felt,
on account of the gross darkness which yet prevails
in regard to what is called preaching the Gospel,
many engaging therein without Divine authority and influence,
who consequently cannot profit the people.
And many others running into it in a mixture: a little of an influence that is of God,
and a great deal of creaturely activity,
without any clear commission or opening in the light; and that,
although so far as this is of God, He owns it, yet it only gathers people to the mixture;
into a degree of living sensibility,
yet with a great deal of independent action and performance;
for that nothing can gather to God in the clearness,
but what is of and from Him in the clearness.
Effects cannot exceed their causes.
This is the linsey-woolsey garment,
not to be for a covering to any of the Lord`'s true servants; whose eye, being single,
their whole body is, and will be full of light: in which light they see things clearly,
and are preserved out of all mixtures, and creaturely performances.
In this stayed and settled state, the Lord often breaks in upon them,
with and in the shinings of pure light,
as the brightness of the sun shining in his full strength,
and sweetly satisfies their souls with the fulness of His love, and life giving presence;
which is as distinguishable, and as distinctly known, from all images, representations,
counterfeit appearances, or mixtures, as the light of the outward sun is known,
by its own light, from any other object.

I write what I know, and only what I know.
Let him hear, that hath an ear.
But those who cannot receive it, must be borne with, and pitied,
rather than reflected upon, or censured; for the loss and unhappiness are their own.
And though, for the good of their immortal souls,
we wish them more acquainted with the deep things of God, the solid,
unmixed enjoyment of divine good, and the clear directions of the Spirit of Truth;
yet ought we patiently to bear with their ignorance, and pray for their illumination;
even though they laugh at, and deride us as ignorant enthusiasts.
"`For whatever is not experimental,`" as Isaac Penington observes, "`is disputable.`"
Therefore, as they have it not in their own experience,
they naturally doubt the experience of others; especially,
as experience is so often pretended for the most extravagant and wild imaginations.
But he that rightly believes, hath the witness in himself;
and what he certainly knows he cannot be in doubt of,
however others may slight his testimony.
But his bowels will often yearn towards them; yea, he will, as it were,
"`travail in birth,`" for them, that Christ may be formed in them.
And though they were to persecute him for his faith and doctrine, he is ready,
under a sense of their ignorance of what is the joy of his soul, to say,
at least in heart, "`Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.`"

Thus we see that Christ Jesus, our blessed Lord, can, even to this day,
manifest Himself unto His faithful followers,
(such as will hearken to no other voice but His,
and who carefully attend to His light in their souls,) in a clear and certain manner,
in which He does not manifest Himself to the world, although some formerly,
who had even been His disciples, and had followed Him in His outward appearance,
were puzzled at a hint of this kind from Him, and queried of Him,
how He would manifest Himself unto them, and not unto the world, His true,
inward disciples, who know His inward voice, and will not follow the voice of a stranger,
(however great a resemblance it may have to His,
the Shepherd`'s voice,) well know how it is that He does
in deed and in truth manifest Himself unto them,
and not, in the same, certain, glorious, distinct manner, to the world.
And yet He does so manifest Himself by His light unto all the world,
as that if they love the light, and bring their deeds to it,
in a full surrender of their own wills, and of their own activity,
they would also soon come to know how He manifests Himself unto His own chosen disciples,
and thus become livingly of that happy number; which is what those who already are so,
do earnestly travail and pray for.

[.blurb]
=== Stripped of Ability.

I attended the week-day meeting of Friends here at Wayne Oak, as it came in course.
It was very small.
I was much stripped,
nor had I ability to say any thing in the meeting until near the close of it.
I seemed to myself the most unworthy messenger that
was ever so far from home on the errand of the Gospel;
though I could, at this time,
scarcely see myself in the character of a faithful minister of Christ,
or think that I had ever been fit for it;
yet I knew that I had had the gospel message to declare,
in the evidence and demonstration of the Spirit, and with power:
and that many times in the course of this religious visit, as well as before.
This I never doubted of,
but it now seemed as if it was almost Impossible that I ever could revive again,
or rejoice in the Lord in the land of the living;
yet after all this I was made to rejoice,
and for this very abasement and reduction of mind.

And this rejoicing increased until I had to express a little of it in the meeting,
much to the tendering of a few brokenhearted Friends present,
though I could not rise into more life than, just in weakness to utter a few expressions;
yet therewith felt easy: but concluded, as I had the day before,
that if way did not open with more clearness for
the continuance of my journey after the Yearly Meeting,
then soon coming on at this place, I might return home:
fully believing that He who called me forth into His service in this land,
would open the way with clearness to proceed as far as His will was for me to go:
and that as He would not withhold the necessary openings, I might safely,
after waiting a proper time without obtaining any manifestations to the contrary,
return to my family;
yet remained given up to go forward if He should open the way for it.

[.blurb]
=== The Harp Hung on the Willow

We had a meeting among the Methodists of New Kent.
J+++.+++ L. had a little testimony among them.
I was quite shut up;
yet after meeting broke up I endeavoured to impress them
with a sense of the utter uselessness of all preaching,
however much it may warm and move upon the passions,
except that which is from a real spring of divine Life in the speaker.
Third-day, 26th, went to Wayne-Oak, and Fifth-day, 28th, I attended Curles meeting;
it seemed almost without light or life until the latter part,
when a gleam of true light appeared; by keeping to which, though in great weakness,
victory was obtained, and the meeting ended to comfort and rejoicing;
though we found it for a long time almost impossible to sing a
song of Zion in a land where the harp was hung on the willow!
For it was truly mournful to see "`the city sit solitary that was full of people.`"
Truth had once prospered here,
but now the posterity of faithful Friends were nearly all carried away captive;
but a little gleam of hope arose in my mind that there would be a revival in this place.

[.blurb]
=== Negroes Visited

My way opening with more clearness,
I got along with much satisfaction and fulness of divine joy,
having divers large and blessed meetings.
One at a Friend`'s house a few miles from Petersburgh, over James River,
one at Gravelly-Run, one at Burleigh, and another at Seacock.
After that at Burleigh, we had a good watering time in the evening, at a Friend`'s house,
among black people and some others, besides a few Friends.
Truth reigned over all in this blessed meeting;
the poor negroes blessing God in accents bespeaking heartfelt reverence,
and deep thankfulness of soul, for this favoured season; one of them in particular,
"`Oh! may I ever bless and praise my great God,
for the great good He has this evening done my
soul- for the sweet precious love that I have felt.
I never felt such heavenly love before; blessed forever be the great God!`"
My heart was much affected at the feeling sensibility which this,
and several more of the poor blacks discovered, in their way, of returning thanks to God,
both in the evening, and again next morning; for they seemed full of songs of praise,
even in the morning, for the evening`'s precious favour.
May the Lord Almighty hold them in His hand forever,
and may my soul never forget the descendings of heavenly rain upon and among
us at that comfortable baptizing season for which His holy name be praised forever.
Amen.
And I am renewedly confirmed,
that there is a real work of divine power among many in this land, both white and black,
though they are yet much unsettled.
May they be brought to witness a greater degree of clearness
and establishment in the everlasting Truth!

[.blurb]
=== Parental Discipline

I rested at my friend Benjamin Arnold`'s, being unwell.
He and his wife were very kind, both being worthy well-engaged Friends;
the fruits of whose godly parental care and authority very plainly and agreeably
appeared in the behaviour and appearance of their well-ordered offspring.
Oh, much lies at parents`' doors!
Much may they do, through divine aid, for their children`'s good,
by proper constant care, watchfulness, advice, reproof, restraint, correction,
and commands; all in Truth`'s authority, as occasion requires:
and that not generally so much in the austerity and rigour of compulsory discipline,
as in the meekness and authority of the Lamb,
which seldom fails to reach the witness in their minds,
and more or less to bring them under the government of truth.
But this is too lamentably neglected in their early, tender years,
till they grow stiff and ungovernable;
and then the parents complain that they cannot manage their children;
whereas the cause is greatly in their own miserable neglect.

What account will such have to render in the days of solemn inquisition.
Oh! that many, very many parents, now too much at ease,
may be aroused to a due consideration of the trust reposed in them,
and see to the discharge of their duty to the precious souls under their care.
Oh! the watchfulness, the inspection, the prayers,
and intercessions of the rightly exercised, godly parent,
on account of the dear children!
How contrary to the carelessness and negligence of too many,
who can allow their children to run into company; and many times,
go from home themselves, or go to bed, and leave them with,
or in the way of such company, as has often been the ruin of too unthinking youth.
And it is to be feared the parents are as unthinking as they:
and indeed this is the best construction I can put upon,
and the best excuse I can find for their dreadful
omission of such necessary care and oversight.
For, if they do seriously think of the danger their children are exposed to,
and yet so sorrowfully neglect a proper inspection and direction,
I know not what excuse they can plead in the day of awful reckoning.

Indeed, this of unthoughtfulness,
which I have said is the best excuse I can think of for them, is but a very slender one;
for how can parents be unthoughtful in such a case,
so immediately interesting to the souls of their dear offspring.
Can they forget the propensities and dangers of youth?
Can they so soon lose the remembrance of their own trials, besetments,
and frequent need of a guardian friend?
Or, can they suppose their children have less need, less difficulty,
less frequent strugglings, temptations, and besetments?
O, see to it, parents, I beseech you, for your own and their precious souls`' sakes,
see to it in season, and unremittingly; great is the care that is necessary,
constant the watch that ought to be maintained.
May the Lord, in tender mercy to the souls of the dear children,
awaken the parents to a more lively sense, and a more watchful, animated,
and extensive discharge of duty in these important concerns.
This is the feeling desire and ardent travail of my soul.
These remarks arose not wholly from the agreeable prospects I had in, and of this family,
but have been on my mind for some time,
under a deep and painful sense of deficiency of care among parents very generally.

However, I rejoice in believing, that notwithstanding the so general neglect,
there are many deeply exercised parents who endeavour honestly
to discharge their duty in the sight of God,
and I have no doubt but they will have a rich reward,
and many of the dear youth will be greatly benefited thereby:
that these may be encouraged, and their number greatly increased,
is the fervent wish and prayer of my soul.

[.blurb]
=== A Prayer

O my God!
Thou hast given me to see the wonders of Thy ways, and, in degree,
the strength of Thine arm!
Thou hast led me through the deeps!-- hast bowed my soul in the
deepest prostration!-- stripped me and emptied me of all things,
and then marvellously displayed, both Thy wisdom, Thy goodness, and Thy power,
in lifting me up again from the dust.
Thou hast given me indeed, "`beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning,
and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.`"
Thou art my God, and through Thy aid I will serve thee forever, Be Thou with me,
go before me, and I will follow Thee; for in Thy presence there is Life,
at Thy Right hand a river of pleasure; therefore to whom could I wish to go,
seeing I know, to my inexpressible consolation, that Thou hast the words of eternal Life?

Thou hast graciously redeemed my soul, and delivered me as it were from the den of lions.
To Thee, and to Thy service, I therefore once more dedicate the remainder of my days.
Draw me and I will run after Thee; command me, and I will obey.
I fear to offend Thee, for Thou hast shown me Thy purity; I adore Thee,
for Thou hast wrought wonders for my soul; I love Thee, for Thou art my Life.
Keep my heart clean, by the word of Thy power, and never, O never, I pray Thee,
suffer my foot to slide!
Continue to fill me with the joy of Thy salvation,
since Thou hast so bountifully shown it unto me.

Take not Thy holy Spirit from me; guide me by the right hand of Thy power;
continue to my soul the quickening efficacy of the live coal from Thine altar:
then will I, at Thy bidding, teach transgressors Thy way, and sinners,
through the operation of Thy baptizing Spirit, shall be converted to Thee.
Even so, O Lord, hasten Thou thy great work in the earth;
draw thousands by the cords of Thy love, and tens of thousands by a clear discovery of,
and a living desire after a full establishment in the beauty of holiness;
till the nations come to serve Thee,
and the kingdoms of the earth to bow before Thy throne;
till righteousness cover the earth as waters do the sea,
and light and life reign triumphant over death and darkness, forever.
Amen.

[.blurb]
=== Benighted Mankind

Oh! the benighted state of mankind!
Thousands of highly professing Christians, and even many of our own society,
have so little knowledge of that solemn, awful,
and most of all profitable worship of God, which is in Spirit, and in truth,
that they are even offended, when the ministers of Christ,
in faithfulness to their holy Shepherd and Leader, are constrained to keep silence;
not daring to rush forward into vocal testimony, till they know Him to put them forth,
and go before them.
Whereas, instead of being offended at this their reverent obedience to the Lord,
every true worshipper is rather disposed to sympathize with them therein,
and rejoice in their integrity to Him, "`without Whom they can do nothing.`"
And those who are thus exercised and carefully engaged as the apostle advises,
"`to __feel__ after God,`" are so abundantly comforted and replenished with His holy presence,
when they are favoured,
(as they mostly are in their approaches to Him in solemn silence,)
to __"`find Him,`"__ that they have therein a "`joy unspeakable,
and full of glory,`" abundantly more consolatory and satisfactory to their souls,
than the finest and most eloquent discourse,
that the wisdom and oratory of man ever produced.

Oh! that mankind knew what it is,
thus in reality to "`draw near unto God;`" for all that thus draw near Him,
will surely find that He "`will draw near unto them,`"
and that in a very sensible and soul-satiating manner.
This is not a work of _reasoning,_ nor a work of _talking,_ but a work of _sensation,_
a work of _feeling._
Hence the beauty and divine propriety of the Apostle`'s
words __"`feel after God:`"__ as also of those other expressions,
of _tasting_ and handling the "`good word of Life, and powers of the world to come.`"

[.blurb]
=== Methodists and Baptists

Next day we had a large meeting at the Methodists`' meetinghouse, many Methodists,
some Baptists, and others attending; but it was rather a dull time, and,
not feeling our minds clear,
we concluded to have another meeting there on first-day afternoon. In the forenoon,
on first-day, we had a blessed, open time at Friends`' meetinghouse;
and in the afternoon, another large crowded meeting at the Methodist meetinghouse,
consisting of a mixed and very unsettled multitude.
We found a pressing engagement to declare the truth among them,
but found them so outward in their minds, and so unstayed,
that we got very little entrance in their minds in general, or relief to our own,
though I believe the Methodists were mostly quiet, and some of them, with a few others,
were reached and tendered.

Second-day, 31st, we left the city with heavy hearts,
after a solid opportunity with Friends.
This day and next we rode towards Georgia, about fifty-eight miles;
and finding a little meeting of Friends, though not members,
yet such as were convinced of Truth`'s way and principles,
we stayed their meeting on fourth day; it was dull at first,
but open and much favoured towards, and in the conclusion.
Several Methodists and Baptists were present,
and truth reached and tendered most of their minds.
These friendly people had, at least part of them,
belonged to the Methodists and Baptists;
but their eyes became gradually opened to see beyond lifeless forms and creaturely performances,
as prayers in man`'s own time and will, etc.,
and had now gathered into a silent waiting upon the Lord.
May they live near Him, love Him, and serve Him in the beauty of holiness:
then they will not only enjoy great peace in themselves,
but be a blessing to their neighbours.

We had a large meeting at Marmaduke Mendenhall`'s among a religious people, Methodists,
Baptists, etc.
Truth eminently overshadowed us, in our first sitting down together.
I had very bright openings, and fullness of light and life;
but the meeting was hurt by the right time not being attended to in standing up,
by me or my companion, or both.
My soul was grieved, for the people were prevented, in degree,
from enjoying what seemed to be intended for them; yet many minds were affected,
and I trust some good was done.
Fourth-day, 9th, we had a large meeting at a Friends`' house, among Methodists, Baptists,
and Friends.
There was strength and utterance given,
and great indeed appeared to be the entrance into the people`'s minds.
Doctrines at this, as at most other times, in these southern lands,
opened and enlarged upon, were:
the universality and sufficiency of saving grace afforded unto all men;
the possibility of all being saved; the possibility of neglecting so great a salvation;
the cooperation of our wills and endeavours with the Divine will,
in the work of reformation; remission of sins past through the mercy of God in Christ;
preservation from evil, through walking in the Spirit,
even to a full overcoming and establishment,
as pillars in the temple of God that shall go no more out: but especially,
the nature of worship, as inward communion with God;
in deep adoration drawing near unto Him; not in outward ordinances and sacraments,
so called, but in a real _feeling after Him,_ and _finding Him too;_
and that in a glorious and sensible manner;
and so worshipping Him _in Spirit and in truth._

Great is the work which the Lord hath wrought in these States,
particularly among the Methodists.
And yet they appear abundantly too much in the Outward court,
resting in the shadowy dispensations, and in duties, so called: as prayers, preaching,
singing, etc., in their own time and strength;
though they profess much of divine influence,
and some of them have been favoured therewith.
Yet they also openly profess it to be their duty, to begin,
and go on in these performances, at their set times,
whether they have a sense of divine aid and requiring or not.
Now, although God has, for a season, favoured many such individuals, and societies,
as they have arisen, one after another, through many ages; yet it is certain,
that as they have thus continued in their self-activity,
and running before the only true Guide,
they have gradually lost the life of true religion;
fading or withering has overcome them, and they have settled into flat formality.

And as sure as this has been the case, with the several societies hitherto,
that have kept up a round of prayers, duties, and performances,
without waiting for divine assistance therein,
so certainly it will continue to be the case with
all such as continue so doing to the end of time.
For, though the Lord has ever condescended to favour such, as having been newly awakened,
and have in sincerity sought Him, under whatever form or ceremony, yet,
as in all dispensations, and through all forms,
the Lord`'s aim has been to lead people to the substance, so,
whenever they have stuck in the forms and creaturely performances,
without pressing on in the life, he has ever, after a season,
withdrawn from them in their duties, as they have called them.

And this withdrawing of His life and presence from them in these things is,
and has been intended by Him,
to lead them into a more inward waiting upon Him for life and ability.
But, alas! they have too often been so outward in their views,
as to mistake the cause and meaning of this want of life and power in their devotions;
and instead of getting into a right waiting, and inward _feeling after God,_
and His holy aid and direction, they have blamed themselves and one another,
for not being more _constant_ and _fervent_ in their set forms, prayers, etc.,
and so have undertaken to double their diligence and fervency; like Baal`'s prophets,
trying to work themselves up to greater heat and vehemency, and much to the same purpose.
For as they do not rightly wait for life, heat, and qualification from the only true God,
who still, as of old,
"`answers by fire,`" they still remain cold and lifeless in their performances,
sinking deeper and deeper into formality,
and feeling less and less of divine life in all their devotions, till, at length,
they have complete possession of the outward court, and that only.

And this will, in time,
as surely be the case with the Methodists as it has been with other societies,
unless they learn to wait for divine help.
For the Lord seeketh spiritual worshippers, such as have come to the _loss of all things,_
and cannot, or dare not, attempt to move forward in any religious service,
without knowing the Shepherd of the sheep to put them forth,
and that clearly and sensibly on every renewed occasion, and to go before them.
Therefore, after bearing with their weakness for a time, and favouring their endeavours,
although in the mixture, in order that they may be encouraged,
and led gradually into the inward temple, and real, spiritual worship, He will,
(if they still continue to run before Him,
instead of waiting to know Him to go before them and also to put them forth),
leave them to their own performances, will-worships, and works of their own hands.
In short, He will leave them to, and in their own righteousness,
which is and ever will be as _filthy rags._
And no better name will any performances ever deserve,
which are only in the will and strength of man.

[.blurb]
=== Set Prayers and Death to Own Will

Every man who ventures to rush forward in the mixture,
though he may feel something divine _for a time,_ is even _then,_
clothed with the _linsey-woolsey garment,_ and is also in great danger, yea,
almost certain, if he thus goes on, to be left, at length, entirely to himself,
without _anything divine_ in his performances.
For the Lord will not be limited to our _set times,_ or bound to assist our _set prayers,_
etc., but will be waited for and felt after.
And those who do rightly wait upon Him, in the silence of all flesh,
shall surely renew their strength in Him.
None ever yet failed of finding it so, who have continued rightly waiting upon Him.
These mount up with wings as eagles,
for strong is He that lifts up their souls in their holy, reverent waiting.
When these pray, it is with divine energy, and the Lord hears their cry.
They run, and are not weary; they walk without fainting;
for they wait on One that is able to direct their steps, and to establish their goings;
whereas faintness, weariness and flatness of formality,
surround those who presume in their own strength,
even though they may hope for divine concurrence.

I am sensible that many in this land are beginning
to grow very weary of their lifeless performances,
and groan inwardly, under a deep sense of the want of substance.
Now this is a call from God to their souls; not, as many weakly imagine,
to stir up themselves, like Baal`'s prophets, to more warmth and vehemence,
but to cease from man, both in themselves and others, and wait upon God, in the real,
inward stripping of all creaturely ability,
in the loss of all their own righteousness and self-motions;
that they may win Christ and His holy aid, and thereby come to witness __all things new,
all things of God.__
And this no man can ever possibly witness, till he stands still,
and ceases from all his own willings and runnings:
for so long as he moves on in his own time and ability, he will have something _old,_
some- thing _not of God._
Here Christ has not reigned, till He has put down all creaturely _rule_ and _authority;_
but something yet liveth and ruleth in every such soul beside Christ.
Such cannot say, that what they are, they are only by the grace of God: nor,
that it is not they that live and act, but Christ that lives and acts in them.

These must still witness a further death to their own wills,
or else a degree of _death_ to things divine, will still have power over them.
For this will be the case with all men, until by or _through death,_
they witness him destroyed, (as to any further rule in them), who has the power of death.
And this can never be known till Christ has so ruled in them,
as that they are fully baptized into His _death,_ and rise with Him in newness of Life.
Here, all things are _new,_ and all things _of God,_ even in this life.
This is God`'s kingdom, come, and His will done in earth, as in heaven.

[.blurb]
=== Family Prayers

After one of these meetings, a Baptist man, somewhat in years,
told me he had tried to keep up family prayers in his house,
but found he could have no satisfaction in it,
unless when he felt a divine influence inclining him thereto,
and that he had now omitted it, except when he found himself thus qualified.
Divers others have confessed, that they had often,
in their attempts to pray at their set times, without waiting for divine help,
evidently felt that their words fell to the ground, were of no avail,
and answered no good purpose.
Oh! that all may learn the necessity of waiting upon God in the silence of all flesh,
and creaturely motions or performances,
that they may witness that renewal of divine strength,
wherein prayer is made with life and acceptance with the Lord.

At the close of another of those meetings, a Methodist woman also expressed,
with tears and tenderness of spirit,
that she found herself much in the state of which I had been led to speak, that is,
in the loss of the life of religion, which she had happily enjoyed in former days.
She now lamented her case, and desired me to remember her, and pray for her,
that she might be again quickened, though she feared she never could be.
She felt near to my life,
and I believed the Lord was graciously renewing His precious visitations to her soul.
So I endeavoured to encourage her to hope, and advised her to be still,
and know God in and for herself;
waiting to feel sensibly the turnings of His hand upon her:
and not get into the willings and runnings, activities and performances of the creature,
in the anxious, unsettled, and hasty desires for relief,
thinking thereby to gain the favour of God, and satisfaction to her own soul.
For by so doing, many have run from Him,
and from the operations of His hand and power upon them; which,
if they had lain low under, and been subjected to,
in the perfect loss of all self-movements, would have wrought out for them,
the eternal salvation of their souls; and sensibly brought them into a living activity,
in the holy seed of Life, wherein all the true-born children cry "`Abba,
Father,`" and therein are always heard and accepted.

[.blurb]
=== Zeal without Life

On third-day, we had an open, refreshing meeting among the Nicholites, so called.
I had a lively evidence that some among them were humbly endeavouring to serve the Lord:
but at the same time I saw clearly that many of them
rested too much in their outside plainness;
and valuing themselves upon that,
had stopped short of a more living acquaintance with the well-spring of eternal Life;
and this is a snare wherein I fear some of our society are taken,
and detained from greater experience in the real life of religion,
without which all outward things are unavailing to the salvation of the soul.
A zeal in these things, without the life of truth,
has tended to settle many into flat formality in the outward Court;
wherein some are greatly _starched_ up,
before they have been _washed_ and made clean in the laver of regeneration.
These still want washing, and _now,_ not only from some of their former filthiness,
but from the _starch_ of false zeal, wherein they ignorantly say in their hearts,
"`Stand by thyself, I am holier than thou.`"
And perhaps this starch may be the worst thing some have about them.

[.blurb]
=== Cleansing the Inside and Outside

Oh! that all may observe the caution, '`Cleanse first the inside of the cup and platter,
and the outside will be clean also.`"
Indeed, I believe, as the work is rightly begun, and carried on within,
a gradual cleansing will assuredly take place, both within and without: and, in general,
much in proportion, the outward to the inward.
For I am far from supposing, that by _cleansing first the inside,_
is meant that no degrees of outward cleansing must take place,
till a thorough cleansing is effected within.
At that rate, I doubt whether the inward cleansing would seldom, if ever,
be thoroughly known.
Let the work begin rightly within, and let the inward change, life, and growth be ever,
and all along, principally attended to, and it will lead, step after step,
through a course of gradual cleansing, even of the outside, but especially within.
And every act of self-denial, in the requirings of truth, and leadings of light and life,
even in outward reformation,
as it proceeds from that which first lays the axe to the root of the corrupt tree,
and thus springs from an inward cleansing:
so will it also tend to further and promote the real, inward work,
and still increase the inward cleansing.

For this tendency every act of self-denial, in obedience to the light, will have;
and on the contrary, every refusal to obey the Light, even in little things,
will tend to prevent an inward cleansing, and to increase defilement.
But take notice,
this tendency of every act of self-denial to promote the inward cleansing,
is only as it takes place in obedience to the _light of life:_
for of ourselves alone we can do nothing that will hasten good to our souls.
There is none really, and of himself, good, but one, that is God.
Therefore, all the real good that any _have,_ is from Him alone;
and all the good that any _do,_ is through Him alone,
in the leadings of His holy light in their own souls.

[.blurb]
=== Parental authority.

Now this hinders not at all, that children should obey their parents in the Lord;
for this is right, yea, well-pleasing unto God.
Every act of self-denial in a child,
in submission to the wholesome rule and advice of a godly parent, guardian, or tutor,
will be acceptable to the Lord.
And all parents that live in His fear, and obey the light,
will find and feel a necessity to train up their children in the way they should walk,
in hope that when they are old, they will not depart therefrom.
It is a parent`'s duty, and every parent attending to the light,
the Word nigh in the heart, will find it so, to train up those under his or her care,
"`in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.`"

And surely, a humble, obedient child, one that attends to the Light in itself,
will not think it hard to submit to what the light directs parents to lay upon it,
or require of it.
Therefore it follows, that every child that will not thus submit to the godly authority,
and wholesome advice of a pious or well-disposed parent, is obstinate, self-willed,
and rebellious.
My desire is, that the Lord may give children hearts of sensibility,
that they may know their duty, and reverence their parents, elders, and tutors,
cheerfully obeying all their lawful commands;
that thus they may be accounted among the godly.
And let parents rule in love, meekness, and sweetness; and yet in the Life, dignity,
and authority of the blessed truth.

I laboured among this people, in the openings of Life,
and hope it was according to their condition;
may it tend to their settlement on the right foundation!

[.blurb]
=== Pitched Battle with Opposers

We had a meeting at the house of our friend Samuel Tomlinson,
where very few friends live near, among Baptists, Methodists, some Friends, etc.
We evidently felt that some of them had pitched in
battle array against us in their minds;
and for a time the Lord suffered them to shut up the kingdom of heaven,
not entering themselves, nor suffering those that gladly would have entered.
At length a small degree of Life arose, and I told them the battle was the Lord`'s,
and if He suffered them to shut up the kingdom, the loss would be their own;
but that it was likely those formerly,
whose unbelief prevented our Saviour`'s doing many mighty works in certain places,
might be ready to vaunt over Him, and to think He could not make His way among them:
and yet I thought their victory, if such they esteemed it, was in no wise glorious;
but greatly to their own loss,
or the prevention of much good that they might otherwise have received.

I then acknowledged to them freely,
that we had nothing at our own command to offer for their good;
nor any weapons of our own to oppose their warlike preparations with:
told them I had little thought, when,
in the pure constrainings of gospel love and good will,
I gave up to have a meeting with them,
that they would have come together prepared for war; but that I was assured it was so,
for I could feel the inward state and opposition of some of their minds,
as plain as I could see their bodies with my outward eyes.
Moreover I informed them, that if the Lord engaged me in it,
I was not afraid or ashamed to fight, even upon a retreat,
if He did not make way for an advance; that I was not at all afraid of my life,
how many Goliaths soever might defy the armies of the living God;
for my life I had given up to his disposal, to be laid down in His cause, if He pleased,
in any part of the globe.
I came not from my own land, and all my near and dear connections in life,
to do my own will, but His who sent me;
and while I stand faithful in His holy will and counsel,
in the openings and leadings of His divine light and life, I fear no evil, danger,
or difficulty, nor all the art and malice of men or devils;
though I fully know that of myself I can do nothing.
However I told them, for their own sakes,
in order that they might have the full benefit of the meeting.
I desired them to lay aside their warlike weapons,
that inward opposition wherein they stood against the inward life of all true religion,
and the doctrines of the everlasting gospel.
And as they knew themselves guilty of an inward opposition to us, and our message,
it began to work conviction in them: they wondered how I knew it:
but seeing I did know it, and was enabled plainly to tell them the inward state,
and thoughts of their own hearts, it won upon them, drew their attention,
removed their prejudices, and softened their hearts towards us and our testimony;
and when I found they had given up, and dropped their warlike weapons and intentions,
I improved the opportunity, as Truth enabled me,
and told them I perceived they began to incline towards a capitulation,
and willingness to sign articles of peace.

[.blurb]
=== Victory

This also they knew was true of the inward alteration of their minds;
and so it greatly tended still further to gain their love and attention, until at length,
(though the work,
or rather warfare was very hard for some time,) we had an heavenly baptizing time together;
truth reigned over all, and therein our souls triumphed over all opposition,
in the strength and power of an endless Life,
wherein divers doctrines of the gospel were livingly opened and enlarged upon,
in demonstration of the Spirit and Our divine authority: yea,
that was felt and acknowledged to be so,
by many whose hearts were greatly tendered and refreshed,
after all the opposition they had at first felt against us.
Thus the Lord wrought for us, and taught our hands to war, and our fingers to fight;
glory be to His great Name forever! for hitherto He hath marvellously helped us;
and we know that without Him we must have turned our backs
in this and many other days of battle.

Next day we had a heavenly open meeting at a Baptist meetinghouse on Abbit`'s Creek,
about ten miles from the last meeting; divers of their members and one of their teachers,
urgingly desiring us to have a meeting with them there,
they being much reached at the other meeting.
We had had thoughts of having a meeting there before this invitation,
and the way now looking very open, we embraced it, and had one accordingly.
And as soon as I sat down in the meeting, I felt,
as evidently as I ever felt any thing with my outward-fingers,
that they were now come without their weapons,
in a state of mind directly the reverse of what they or some of them felt
in the forepart of the meeting yesterday. Their hearts were open,
and our way was also soon opened into a living enlargement in the doctrines of truth,
I trust to our and their mutual satisfaction and consolation of soul,
though their outward performances and lifeless devotions
were largely and livingly testified against.

[.blurb]
=== North Carolina Yearly Meeting

Next day, being seventh of the week, and 24th of 10th month,
began the select Yearly Meeting at Centre, in North Carolina, for Friends of that State,
South Carolina, and Georgia.
It was a trying season, and Friends seemed sensible it was a very low time.
I was quite sealed up in deeply suffering silence,
as were both my companion and myself next day, at the public meeting for worship.
On second-day the business of the society came on; it continued by adjournment four days,
and though the forepart was heavy and trying,
yet the latter part was a time of eminent overshadowing of the Holy presence.
Many weighty subjects were considered in this Yearly Meeting,
and finally resolved with much unanimity, love, and solemnity.
Many forward spirits were much on the flutter, and were hurtful for a day or two;
but were greatly bound down by Truth`'s arising toward the last,
and the meeting for business, and select meeting, concluded,
on the fifth day of the week, in a solemn and soul-tendering manner.

I was much bowed down, until the last day,
under a distressing sense of the want of due dependence on the Lord, in many present;
but near and at the close of the meeting, the Helper of Israel opened a way,
and helped me to be thoroughly relieved, and the song that is ever new,
was put into my heart and mouth, in a very consolating manner.
Large numbers, I believe, will at times while they live,
bless the name of the Lord for that day`'s favour.
The shout of a King was heard in Zion, to the rejoicing of the tabernacles of Jacob.
Bless Thy God, O Israel, forever, and serve Him with faithfulness and reverence,
O daughter of Jerusalem, for Who indeed is like Him!
He bringeth down as into the very dust, and He raiseth up to the heights of salvation.
He maketh the dumb to declare of His goodness,
the inhabitant of the rock to sing of His power!
Glory be to His Name forever; my soul will praise Him in the heights of Zion.

[.blurb]
=== Satan Let Loose--His Head Bruised

About this time Satan seemed almost let loose upon me, to buffet me with doubts,
even in things wherein I had been well established and assured,
as that the soul died with the body, and never liveth again.
And oh! how this distressed me!
The libertine may wish the soul was mortal; may persuade himself to hope it is so:
but I can say in truth,
scarce any thought that Satan ever had power to excite in my mind,
was so afflicting to me.
It sunk me, I was ready to think, lower than ever I was before.
The language of my oppressed soul was, "`If this be so,
I shall never arise into divine Life and consolation any more.
All is over.
Oh, that I had never had a being.`"
No one can conceive the extreme bitterness of this conflict,
unless experience has taught him.
Annihilation was the most dreadful prospect I ever had.

To have lived, and enjoyed such heavenly consolations;
such soul-satiating communications of divine good: the love of God,
shed abroad in my soul, in a manner so completely satisfying- in a manner,
the mere natural man knows nothing of: and that from time to time, for many years,
(through deep tribulations,) and after all this, to become totally extinct,
and swallowed up,
in never-ending darkness!--forgetfulness!--insensibility!--non-existence!
It shocked and prostrated all my fortitude.
I sincerely chose rather to be eternally, in some considerable degree, miserable,
than thus to die to all existence, sensation, and be cut off from being and existence.

I am sure,
I have no words adequate to the full and clear description of the horror and distress,
that seized and bore down my drooping soul.
Oh! Said I,
how is it possible for the most profligate and abandoned wretch
to wish his soul were mortal, to wish himself annihilated! to wish
eternal midnight spread over that little spark of life in himself,
into which the light of heaven has often shined!
I thought, let my life have been ever so desperate,
I would rather hope in God`'s goodness, and rely On His mercy and forbearance,
under the idea of eternal existence, than submit to the dreadful,
truly dreadful prospect of a total extinction.
But, alas! the more my own will arose,
the more the strugglings of my own creaturely desires prevailed,
or opposed this dreadful, (indeed to me), most dreadful prospect,
the firmer it seemed fixed and rooted in my gloomy soul.
If holy angels were conscious of my sadness, or knew my piercing anguish of spirit,
I think they surely commiserated my pain, and if they know how to sympathize,
must feel my weight of woe.

[.blurb]
=== Resigns the Future to God

But God, my only helper, whose I am,
and to whose service I have dedicated my life and my all,
well knew why he permitted the tempter to have such length of chain,
and so exceedingly to afflict me.
I have since clearly seen, that His determination was, that if I would still be His,
I should lay down my life, and that of my own will, entirely in all things; and take Him,
and His will, for my only good, in and through all, both in time and in eternity.
But before I clearly saw this, my own will and choice began to bow and yield.
The language of my thoughts began to run on this wise, though still in great pain:
Here I am in the wilderness of this world.
I have known great things; seen the Lord`'s wonders in the deeps;
enjoyed many cups of unspeakable consolation, and tasted often of wormwood and of gall.
I did not create myself.
I am not the author of my own existence;
neither shall I be the disposer of my own future condition, and final allotment.
Why then do I so ardently strive about that which I cannot at all influence?
My God, who has been good, beyond expression, to me as I oft-afflicted soul,
and who has never failed, as I have bowed to his will and stood firm in faith, patience,
and integrity, to bring joy out of every complaint, will surely do right,
and order my future state for the best.
My business is to obey Him, in all things: to be faithful to His requirings;
follow Him wheresoever He leadeth, through fire or water;
and unwaveringly to trust in Him, even "`though He slay me,`" And in so dong,
I may safely leave things; futurity to His all-wise disposal.

[.blurb]
=== Satan`'s Head Bruised

Here my own will was once more crucified and slain.
Here my life was laid down upon the cross.
All within me bowed.
On this wise then, my soul addressed my God: "`Lord, I know that Thou art all goodness.
I have drunk of the rivers of pleasure at Thy right hand,
which is all of Thy mere bounty and grace.
I surrender my all once more to Thee, without reserve.
Here I am.
Do with me whatever Thou pleasest, here and hereafter, forever.
I am Thine.
Thou created me.
Thy Son died for me.
I die daily, and am buried by baptism, into death, with Him.
Thus, obtaining remission of sins through His name,
and sanctification through Thy holy Spirit,
be Thou therefore the only director of my life, the sole disposer of my spirit.
I cannot doubt that all will be well, and ordered for the best, respecting my soul,
if I yield wholly to Thy will, and the direction of Thy inward light.
If I am only for a moment, all will be well; Thy will be done.
Blessed be Thy Name, and adored forever, Thy goodness, that I have known Thee,
and enjoyed Thy love, which is better than life.
If Thy wisdom direct a period of my existence, an absolute termination of my joy,
Thine only it is to create, Thine only to dispose of Thy creature.
And whether I live forever to sing Thy praise, or am struck off from existence,
and sealed up in endless insensibility and eternal night, I yield to Thy will.
Not mine, but Thine be done, now, henceforth, and forever.
Amen.

After this full surrender of my will and my all, light sprang in my soul;
darkness fled before it; Satan`'s head was bruised; God did truly bruise Satan under me:
I saw his power was limited: and that the Lord God Omnipotent still reigned over all.
Life and immortality was again, as it were,
brought to light out of the depth of obscurity,
and established over all in meridian brightness and assurance in my soul.
Great enlargement followed this sore conflict, and my consolation was full,
and unspeakably glorious.
Blessed forever be the Lord my God, and wonderful leader!
In the heights my soul will praise Him,
and for the depths of prostration will I magnify His Name,
who makes all things work together for good to those who truly love Him.
Love Him, O my soul, forever, and submit Thy all to His holy care and keeping,
through every vicissitude of time; through all the possible events of eternity;
for goodness, infinite goodness is the essence of His being;
unerring wisdom and prudence the measure and standard of all His acts, ordinances,
and dispensations.

[.blurb]
=== Dangers in Heights and Depths

I believe I have never known a more constant fullness of God`'s love, life,
and qualifying presence nor a more continued cheerfulness in and out of meetings,
for so long a time, than, blessed be the Lord, I have now been favoured with,
since my extreme tribulation and distress at Smith`'s-Creek, and about that time.
Oh, the heights and depths! may neither the one nor the
other ever separate my soul from the love of God.
I well know the propriety and need of our Saviour`'s caution,
"`Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter: neither on the Sabbath-day.`"
Great care is necessary, in both these states.
Perhaps our Lord mentioned the winter first,
as it is the trials and distress of that painful dispensation, which prepares for, and,
if patiently endured, terminates in the comfortable rejoicings of the Sabbath-day.
To abound, we must be abased; if we will reign with Christ, we must suffer with Him.
But, oh the danger of letting in discouragements in the winter season,
when all seems cold and uncomfortable within; even sometimes benumbing,
and almost deadly frost.
Here, thou exercised traveller Zionward,
if thou art not very watchful and careful to abide
in the faith and patience of the saints,
thou wilt be very likely to take thy flight,
from walking in the light and firm abiding on the everlasting rock and foundation,
by letting in and giving way to doubts, disputings, distrust, murmurings, and despair;
and so repine at the dispensations of Divine Providence,
who is proving thee for thy good, by sinking into melancholy, dejection, and despondency:
or, on the other hand, through these reasonings and discouragements, letting go thy hold,
concluding it is all in vain to struggle any longer for victory;
and so give way to let in some temptation or other,
and seek to unlawful enjoyments for relief.

Here many have taken their flight in the winter,
and let go their hold of what they had received, and so have lost their crown.
For the terms are, "`be thou faithful unto death,
and I will give thee a crown of life,`" But if thou
abidest steadfast through the wintry dispensation,
the Lord will bring thee to the opening spring, to the summer, and the Sabbath-day.
Here thou wilt praise Him on the banks of deliverance;
here thou wilt be made to shout and sing; "`for lo, the winter is past:
the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth:
the time of the singing of birds is come and the
voice of the turtle is heard in our land.`" But now,
in the midst of thy rejoicing, have a care; stand fast;
see thou take not thy flight on the Sabbath-day.
Danger awaits thee on every side: thou art a frail mortal, and thy destruction,
if it cometh upon thee, will be of thyself; but thy help can be only in and of the Lord.
Therefore look unto Him, for "`he that trusteth in his own heart, is a fool.`"
Let him that thinketh he standeth, even though his soul is filled with good,
and overflows with songs of joy, take heed lest he fall.
Even now this care is eminently necessary;
this is a moment wherein the watch is peculiarly needful.
Our Lord knew what was in man,
hence the precious caution in regard to these two seasons of most pressing danger; hence,
also, he preached _the watch,_ and that repeatedly, to His disciples, yea to _all:_
"`What I say unto you, I say unto __all--watch.`"__
He knew all needed it; not only the dejected and distressed soul, but even,
and especially, the joyful heart; the mind of him whose joy overflows.

=== Spiritual Pride

My soul well knows the mystery of these things by repeated experience; but I have found,
that, in proportion as all pride of every kind is done away, or hid from man,
(which is God`'s work,) and the creature fully humbled
and reduced to the loss of all things,
the Lord is pleased more abundantly to fill us with divine good:
and to continue its blessed replenishings unto us:
for through this abasement we are enabled to bear this fullness without being puffed up,
or thinking great things of ourselves.

Man is exceedingly inclined to independence, and a language on this wise:
my own arm has brought salvation; is not this great Babylon, which _I,_ great _I,_
have builded, for mine own and kingdom`'s honour, etc.? Yes.
O thou who thus buildest, be assured, whenever thou beginnest to think much of thyself,
and that thou of thyself hast done something that is good,
thou art a Babylonish idolater; thou art erecting a Babel.
This is great Babylon indeed, which thou, a poor worm of the dust, art rearing up;
and all this must be brought down, before thou comest to live _by faith,_
or canst say in truth, "`I live; yet not I,
but Christ liveth in me;`" and "`by the grace of God, I am what I am.`"
It is truly a great attainment to be nothing but what grace maketh us;
yet this is the case, in regard to the things of religion,
with all who "`do nothing of themselves, but have _rested from_ their own works,
as God did from His:`" here "`God is all in all.`"
Oh! seek it; lay hold of it, and secure it to thy soul, by _dying daily;_
dying unto all that can or would act of itself, make haste, or be always ready;
for this can never do any thing better, whatever it boasts,
than build for thee and others a _Babel of confusion._
Therefore let him that hath an ear hear,
for this is what the Spirit of the Lord now saith unto the churches,
in order to gather all that will follow the Lamb, into the living gospel worship,
in spirit and in truth, within the inward temple.

=== Foolish Looking Out for Words

+++[+++Quarterly Meeting at Halifax.]
I was shut up throughout, except some close communications in the select meeting,
and in that for public worship on first-day.
My soul was deeply distressed under a sense that
some were neglecting an inward _feeling after_ God,
and were foolishly looking out for words.
Oh! how this wounds the living,
and adds to the bonds of those who have no other to look to, but the Lord alone!
Scarce anything tends more powerfully to shut up the springs of Life.

[.blurb]
=== Formality through Want of Waiting

Next day, being 3rd of the week, and 26th of the month,
I attended the Quarterly Meeting of ministers and elders at Third-Haven;
the two next days was held the Quarterly Meeting for church discipline,
on the day following the Monthly Meeting there.
The two first of these four days were painfully exercising,
but through patience in tribulation, and not presuming to put forth a hand,
or go forward, until the Shepherd of Israel went before me,
leading me on in the openings of light and life, I at length obtained deliverance,
triumphed over all opposition,
and coming forth from under that weight of death and darkness I had felt,
found renewed ability, the two last days, thoroughly to relieve my mind among them:
which was not only to the reproof of the lukewarm and disobedient,
but abundantly to the watering and refreshment of those
who were truly hungering and thirsting after righteousness.
I was made sensible that there was present a little remnant who truly loved the Lord,
and whose meat and drink it was to do His will, and, blessed be His Holy Name forever,
they, with my own soul, were eminently filled.
Next day I had a meeting at the Bay side.
It was silent and dull for a long time,
after which my mouth was opened in the pure gospel spring,
and the meeting continued about two hours longer, in a very open and relieving manner,
the nature of gospel worship and of all real gospel ministry,
being largely opened to the people; may it fasten as a nail in a sure place.
Oh! how I have mourned before the Lord,
under a sense of the death and formality which reign in Christendom,
for want of waiting for divine help,
and through pushing forward in man`'s time and ability,
which brings forth but a form of godliness and devotion,
without the life and power of it.
May the Lord open the eyes of the people, that they may see, and unstop their ears,
that they may hear what the Spirit saith to the churches, which at this day,
is in a very special manner, "`Cease from man, from all self-activity,
and wait upon the Lord for qualification to worship him in spirit, and in truth.`"

=== Abraham Saw the Day of Christ

"`Abraham saw my day, and was glad,`" says Christ.
Oh! he really saw it,
and came to it though perhaps this can be as little
believed by most professing Christians now,
as it could be then by the Jews.
For professions and names alter not the inward states of men.
Blindness is as predominant now among Christians (so called), as then among the Jews.
"`Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?`"
said the Jews.
Alas! their thoughts and views were outward.
They no more knew what Christ meant by Abraham`'s seeing His day,
than nominal Christians now know.
Indeed they knew no better than these, who, or what Christ was,
nor of whom He spoke when He said "`my day.`"
They doubtless thought He spake of Himself as a man, and of his day,
as the day of his then visible appearance.
But He told them, "`Verily I say unto you, before Abraham was, I am.`"
Was it any wonder they thought Him mad or a blasphemer?
Well, how much better apprehensions have nominal Christians?
It is likely, out of veneration for Christ, and His assertion,
they will grant He was before Abraham,
and that Abraham saw His day afar off by an eye of faith.
But the true Christian has a lively evidence that
Abraham was truly and livingly in the day of Christ,
in the life, power, and enjoyment of the very substance of the real gospel day in spirit,
though the life and power of that day was not then so fully and clearly brought in,
in the experience of mankind, as afterwards.

Now, O Christian! see that thou stumble not,
at the same stumbling stone at which the Jews stumbled.
Have a care lest thy views be as outward as theirs.
What did Christ mean to convey, in saying, "`before Abraham was, I am?`"
Did He mean only to evince, that Abraham might, by faith,
behold His day and appearance afar off?
Or did He not rather mean to show, that as Christ was long before Abraham,
and the same yesterday, today, and forever, therefore Abraham might,
and did as truly see, come to, and rejoice in His day, as any did then,
in the days of His outward coming;
and much more so than any who then only beheld His outward day, works, and appearance.
Yea, much more truly so than professing Christians now do,
though ever so high in zeal and veneration for the Name, and outward worship of Christ,
unless they come to know Him livingly and powerfully in them,
the only hope of their glory.
There is no doubt with me that Abraham and many more in those days,
as truly saw and came into the very life and power of the day of Christ,
as Christians since have done.
"`Before Abraham was, I am,`" says He; not I was,
though that would have been strictly true.

But saying, I AM, was saying more than to say I was: for saying, "`Before Abraham was,
I am,`" was not only saying Abraham had a beginning, and I the power and word of God,
had none, and so was long before him, but was in substance saying, I am the same,
forever.
I change not.
My taking upon me this body, makes no alteration in me.
I am now.
I am of old.
I am to all eternity, the same.
"`Lo, I come,`" said He, on another occasion, and adds,
"`a body hast Thou prepared Me.`" See here, how clear! "`I come.`"
This is He, (the Word, the power,) that was, and is, and is to come,
or what is exactly equal to it, He that can truly say of himself, I am.
Well: "`I come,`" says He, "`to do Thy will.`"
"`A body hast Thou prepared me.`"
Here is the I, the Me, that came, the I am, whose day Abraham saw, and rejoiced in,
and here is also distinctly, a body prepared for Him.
The body was not the I AM, but was prepared for Him.
His day was not the day of His bodily appearance, but His spiritual day,
known even to Moses,
as long ago as when he heard that important language
of truth "`I am that I am,`" known to Abraham,
David, and others of the patriarchs, known to the three children in the fiery furnace,
when there appeared among them a fourth whose form was like the Son of God.

Indeed, I know of nothing to prevent such in any age of the world,
as were enough inward in the attention of their minds,
and strictly obedient to divine manifestations, from seeing the day of Christ
(the Word), and coming into the life and dominion of it.
And the reason why men do not believe this, is,
that notwithstanding all their talk and profession of Christ,
they do not know him themselves, nor understand what is meant by His day.
If they truly, livingly, and fully knew His day, in themselves,
they would have a satisfactory evidence in reading the life of Abraham,
that he knew Christ and saw His day, not afar off only, as Balaam saw it,
but nigh at hand, and in himself.

Christ`'s day is spiritual, and is the same, as to the spirituality of it, in all ages.
It is known only, in a living, inward, and spiritual knowledge of,
and acquaintance with Christ himself.
A historical knowledge of Him, never brought a soul to see His day: nay,
an outward personal acquaintance with the body which the Father prepared for Him,
to do His holy will in, brought no man in that day to know Him the I AM, the Christ,
the Saviour, who was before Abraham.
"`He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father`" said Christ.
Now think a little.
Did everyone who saw that body, see the Father?
Nay, verily.
Who, or what then was the Me he spoke of, in saying, "`He that hath seen Me,
hath seen the Father?`"
Surely this was one that natural eyes never saw; the One that dwelt in the outward body,
which was prepared for Him.

And indeed and in truth, all who saw Him, must needs see the Father;
for His very name is "`the everlasting Father,`"
though in time conceived and brought forth in man,
thus becoming strictly and truly, "`the son of man,`" as well as the Son of God.
He was in the beginning with God, and was and is God.
And though, being brought forth in the Virgin, and in every real Christian,
makes no alteration in Himself, as being the eternal word of God;
yet as having a conception and birth in man, he became a Son; and as a son,
and as begotten, He must have become so, and must still become so.
Although as the eternal, quickening word of life,
and of all-creating energy and production, He must have truly been,
not only with God in the beginning, but must absolutely have been God,
strictly and truly the mighty God, the everlasting Father; so strictly and truly so,
that He might from eternity say truly, "`I am,
and there is none else beside Me.`" There was no other mighty God,
nor everlasting Father.
He was one, and His name one.
There was no twain about him, no such thing as three "`persons.`"
This is all a mere fiction, a gross misunderstanding of Scripture.
It is absolutely ridiculous to tell of three "`persons,`" and yet but one God.
God is eternal.
His Word is himself, is eternal, and is in no wise diversified
or divided from himself, but is strictly, and absolutely,
and eternally one, to all intents and purposes possible.

Let it be kept in mind that "`the kingdom of heaven is within you,`" as Christ declares.
And unless you find it there, you will never find it any where:
whenever you find it there, you will find God, the eternal Father of all,
as the root and spring of all operation.
The beginning of this kingdom is the Word,
which having been inspoken or breathed into the soul,
and brought forth in a real living birth of divine life, is now strictly become a son,
and that not only the Son of God,
but as strictly and truly the "`son of man,`" I am
not speaking of that body that was born of Mary,
though I believe that to hold a lively analogy with this, as a figure,
but I am speaking now of Christ in us, the hope (indeed our only hope) of glory:
He that in himself is the same forever, but as begotten, and born in us,
becomes the Son of God and of man, our Immanuel, God with us.
Herein, God is (as well as was) in Christ,
reconciling the world (our hearts) unto Himself; of twain making "`one new man,
and so making peace.`"

It is as true this moment as ever it was, "`to us a child is born, to us a son is given.`"
This was not merely a prophecy of something then to come, but was,
in the then present tense, strictly true, and is so in the now present time,
and will remain so, as long as true Christians continue to be brought forth And further,
it is now as true as ever, even in the present tense, "`Thou art my beloved son,
this day have I begotten thee.`"
God begets him now, as truly as ever.
And as none else can beget him but God, so God alone can be his Father.
But as being begotten implies a mother too, as well as a father, some may query,
if he is now daily begotten, who is his mother?

As the Jews could not see, either how Christ could be the Son of God,
or how he could have seen Abraham, or Abraham him, or His day: so many,
called Christians, can as little see how Christ can be now begotten, and brought forth,
so as that it may be said, "`this day,`" meaning now, this instant of time,
"`I have begotten thee,`" nor can they better fathom,
how he can have any other mother than Mary, and Mary has been long dead,
as was Abraham when Jesus spoke of him.
It is the same veil that blinds Jews then.
But let us hear what Christ himself says,
"`Whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same, is my brother,
and sister, and mother.`"
Had not this been said before now, it would be thought blasphemy, with some, to assert it.
But it is truth, strict truth, in the deep mystery and vision of God.

[.blurb]
=== The Death of Christ

It was not only that outward, prepared body of Christ, that submitted to death,
his very soul was made an offering for sin, as it is written,
"`When thou shalt make His soul an offering for sin.`"
His life was not only _taken_ by the Jews, in the cruel act of crucifixion,
but He himself _laid down_ His life, for this He had power to do.
Indeed, He not only died _for_ sin, He also died _to_ sin.
And this might have been known from the nature of _the death of Christ in man,_
if the apostle had not asserted it, but he has asserted it, saying, "`In that He died,
He __died unto sin once,__ but in that He liveth, he liveth unto God.`"
How could He _die unto sin_ who _knew no sin?_
He had in Him all the life and power of every sinful motion,
and was "`tempted in all things`" as we are.
His dying _unto sin_ was His submitting that _death_
should pass upon every sinful motion and inclination,
before ever any of them came forth into gratification, or were so _finished,_
as to bring forth _sin._
So that when I call them sinful motions and desires,
I only mean they would have become sinful if cherished, and suffered to live and reign,
just as the apostle calls his dying to them, _dying unto sin._

Indeed it was, even in him, in this sense,
a real death unto all the life and power of sin, or sinful motions,
though never once suffered to proceed to the actual commission,
or even entertainment of sin itself.
And this is the most effectual _dying unto sin_ of any that can be.
Nor do I think any of us can perfectly arise with Christ,
and steadfastly walk with Him in the newness of life, till we _die with Him unto all sin,_
in this very way, that is, before we give it entertainment.
We must first die to all actual sin,
and then to the first life and risings of it in the mind.
Here the true subjection is known,
when "`every thought is brought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.`"
This subjection and death He knew, for He had a will of His own, and as man,
would gladly have had the cup pass from Him, but, being in the perfect subjection,
"`not __My will,__`" says He, "`but __Thine__ be done.`"
If he had not had a will of His own,
He could not have been in all things like us except sin, nor ever once have _died to sin,_
and so could not have overcome the world and the devil through death.

But now, He has overcome all,
even the utmost strength and art of all the powers of darkness,
and remains as able to do it in us, as in that body,
for therein He had to combat all the powers of seduction and temptation.
And He can never have more to encounter in us, except that as He in us,
and we by Him may overcome the power of evil habits, we may therein do the _greater works,_
of which He spake to His disciples, when he said,
"`Greater works than these shall ye do.`"

Some seem to be very easy in their sins, and think to have Christ as a cloak for them,
or that He will save them therein.
The truth is, the gospel goes as much further than the written law,
in the destruction of the very life and root of sin, as not giving way to anger,
or resisting evil or violence by violence, is further than an "`eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth.`"
Away then with all cunning inventions, or schemes of salvation by Christ,
(as vainly pretended), that strike not at the very life and power,
root and branch of sin.

We must die to it all, or never be saved,
take up our daily cross and follow Him in true self-denial, or be none of His disciples.
This was and is, the life or work of Christ.
It is daily self-denial,
and it will be forever impossible to be His followers further than we die unto sin,
and live under a constant cross and denial of self.
This, and nothing but this is burial by baptism into death _with Him._
And had He not died unto sin,
the expression of our baptism into death with Him had wanted much, if not most,
of its present beautiful and divine propriety.

If any think it strange, that I say, Christ is now daily crucified and slain,
or that He now lays down His life and suffers with His brethren, let them consider,
that even in His crucifixion by the Jews, the divine life never died.
It was only that which was united to the divine life that died.
Christ, as God, as the divine life, is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
And yet what perils, what trials, what varied and different states, and difficulties,
did the man Christ Jesus pass through!
So now the begotten of God in the saints has many trials, and advances gradually,
and is often crucified and slain.
But even in those souls where he is pressed as a cart with sheaves, borne down,
oppressed, and slain, the eternal divinity, the divine life, the holy Word, is not slain.
It is the life which was quickened and raised in
that which was united to the divine life in the soul,
that suffers death.
The _death_ is only upon that which was once made alive, by union with Him who is the life,
and this was the case in His crucifixion.

It is often said, "`Christ died.`"
Yet we know it impossible for the eternal, divine life of Christ, ever to die.
That which lives by union with the life, was and is,
in and by virtue of the union called Christ; this may, did and does die,
is often crucified and slain.
And not only so, but as Christ had in that which was then united to Him in that body,
a selfish or creaturely will to deny,
or life to lay down in which denial he died _unto sin_ so now, in the state of infancy,
as to union with the divine life, there is a will or life often to be laid down,
and therein the saints bear about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus;
fill up their measure of His remaining sufferings, and are baptized into death with Him.
And as in that body, even in its infantile and very weak state, the human nature,
in union with the divine, partook of the Name, and of the sonship; so it is now;
the promise is sure to all the seed.
The seed is one in all forever.
In it all the families of the earth are blessed.
In it, the life, opposed to the divine life, is laid down.
"`Not my will, but Thine be done,`" is constantly the language in all,
as soon as the begotten is brought forth.
May this become more and the more experience of mankind.

[.blurb]
=== Let Him Arise

I find yet need of dying daily; I have in good degree submitted to it this day.
Lord! let not Thine hand spare nor Thine eye pity,
until Thou bringest forth judgment unto victory in me.
I find it good for my soul to wait upon, look unto, and, as living desires arise,
breathe to and supplicate my God.
For though I know I cannot alter Him, He is always, altogether alike, and the same, yet,
as His operation is steadily upon us,
by drawing near to Him in that whereby He is drawing us to Himself, He draws near to us,
as to our sense and enjoyment of Him.
He is steadily drawing, or operating upon the hearts of men, and when men yield thereto,
so as to let Him arise, or be lifted up in them, He will draw all such unto Him,
agreeably to our Saviour`'s words, '`And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
will draw all unto me.`"
But, take notice, He does not do it, till He is lifted up in them,
and He cannot be lifted up in them, till they will let Him arise.
Hence the propriety of the injunction, "`Let God arise and let His enemies be scattered.`"
Hence also the truth and propriety of Christ`'s mournful expostulation with the Jews.
"`How often would I have gathered you, etc., but ye would not.`"

Man can never make God arise, nor profitably attempt to awake the beloved of souls,
till He please.
Yet man may, and ought to _let Him arise._
On the contrary man can and too often does hinder His arising in his own soul.
His proper business is to wait on Him, in a silent, inward travail of spirit,
to feel his arisings.
This is that drawing near unto God, which issues, if rightly and perseveringly performed,
in His drawing near unto us, that is, we feel more and more of His presence.
As when a man in a boat, with a rope made fast to a rock,
by pulling at the rope draws himself to the rock,
though the rock seems to move toward the boat, so in drawing near to God,
He seems to meet us, and we more fully behold and enjoy Him, notwithstanding he rests,
and remains, as to Himself, just where and what He was, unmoved, unaltered.
Yet man may, and ought to let Him arise.
This simile, though pertinently descriptive of the true waiting upon, and prayer to God,
may seem to such as don`'t experience the thing itself, in themselves,
to imply the propriety of vocal prayer to God at any set time that men may appoint, because,
in case of the rock, it is optional with the man in the boat.
But this thought goes not deep enough.
For, beside that the rock is dead, and God is alive forever,
and that God has a most powerful influence and operation on the souls of men,
which the rock has not, it should be considered that unless the rope from the boat,
has fast hold of the rock,
(which sometimes it has not,) all the man`'s pulling and toiling will be in vain,
as that of the fishermen who toiled all night and caught nothing.
But as they, when day arrived, (the proper time to work),
and He who had a right to direct, and put them forth, gave the direction,
and they attended thereto, caught a very great draught of fishes,
so may the man in the boat, when his rope has fast hold of the rock, draw himself to it,
and so may the soul, in true prayer, having firm and living hold of the Eternal Rock,
draw nigh unto it, and feel it drawing nigh to him.

But as no comparison holds absolutely, so here.
It is God that is the first in operation.
He loves us before we love him.
He is, of His own unchangeable love and goodness,
and according to the necessity of His nature and ours, and to His design in our creation,
moving and operating upon us for our good, and in order to draw us to Himself.
This influence and operation, we should more abundantly and sensibly feel,
than many often do, were we enough inward, and attentive to it, and waiting for it.
Other attentions divert us from it, and by absorbing and taking up our thoughts,
and occupying our minds, render us almost insensible of those operations upon us,
which it is impossible we should be wholly without;
and which would soon become lively and powerful upon us, if enough attended to.

[.blurb]
=== Prayer Unuttered and Uttered

This is the business of silently waiting upon God.
It is to witness the mind divested of those encumbering and intruding things,
which hinder a lively sense of the drawing cords of God`'s love and power upon us,
that being thus divested, we may stand open to,
and be fully and feelingly sensible of divine operation.
And herein, (as it is the divine life, thus turned to, by turning from other attachments,
that quickens us, not we ourselves,) we feel ourselves to have some watch unto prayer,
first watching,
(for the injunction is "`watch and pray`") we often feel
the true spirit of supplication revive in our souls,
wherein we draw nearer and nearer unto God.

And this, often at first, and frequently throughout a whole meeting,
rises only to an inward prayer to God, that cannot be safely,
or without loss of the life of it, vocally expressed, because the Spirit, at such times,
helpeth our infirmities, only with and in inward groanings,
that cannot be rightly uttered.
And how greatly should we err, were we to attempt to utter ourselves,
in vocal supplication, at a time when all the aid and assistance received,
arises only to, and terminates in, such inward groanings.

But at other seasons, He who opens and none can shut, so helps us, opens our way,
and aids our utterance, that in fervent, vocal intercessions,
our souls are sweetly and very profitably poured forth to God,
who in this case always hears: He cannot deny His own.
Though he changes not, is not altered by any of our petitionings, yet if we lie low,
and humbly wait under His influence upon us, till it results in solemn supplication,
and we keep to it singly in the spring and motion of His divine word of life and power,
not putting ourselves forth, nor going before nor beyond this quickening influence,
opening and leading,
we shall pray only for what is according to His good will to grant us.

This is true prayer.
This is truly drawing near to God; which is the same to us as His drawing near to us.
But a hasty, zealous approach in words, in our own time and anxious desires,
effects no good purpose.
It certainly cannot alter God; and as certainly it cannot draw us nearer to Him,
because not in His motion upon us,
and without our having any true and substantial hold of Him.
Men pray as if they thought they could move or alter God.
They think if they stir up themselves to ask, and,
with a good deal of creaturely animation,
do ask for what they _think_ they stand in need of,
it will induce Him to hear and grant their request.
But in all this, they are too ignorant of Him, His nature and attributes.
His unalterable nature is such, that all good to our souls is of Him,
and through His operation on us; and therefore, if ever we pray to any real advantage,
we must be sensibly drawn, and wrought into a substantial spirit of true prayer,
by His Divine power; else we may, to almost as good a purpose, pray to Mahomet, or Baal,
as to God.
For Baal could as soon hear, and answer his prophets, as God can hear, with approbation,
and grant the prayer that is not of His own begetting.

We act as if we would change according to our will, the true,
living and unchangeable God, when we attempt to prevail on Him by words,
of our own creaturely conceiving, to do something for the good of our souls.

He acts from His own eternal nature and disposition, and that always the same:
and is to us, just according as we are to Him.
If we accost Him in words, prompted by our own active, anxious, hasty desires,
without knowing our hearts livingly touched by His own live coal from His heavenly altar,
we can but obtain the empty echo, in return, to the sound of our voice;
for He will not be moved.
But if we do livingly and feelingly lay hold of Him, and draw near to Him,
in the drawings of His cord of Divine love upon us, He draws near to us,
and we receive substantial blessing.
Because, He is to us, just as we are to Him.
If we are _alive_ to Him we feel Him, in the same proportion, _alive_ in us.
If we are dead to Him, even though we pray ever so loud and often,
and tell Him ever so solemnly, "`The Lord liveth`"; we speak falsely.
For, as to any sensible, living knowledge of Him, He is as a dead god to us.
Therefore, as it is in ourselves, or in our actual state, so only it is in reality.
And he that can be satisfied with a lifeless round of set devotions,
that join not his soul to God, in a holy, cementing,
consolating union in the Divine Life, does but snuff up the wind,
and will reap the whirlwind.
He but mocks God; and God will mock him, when His fear cometh.

True prayer is always heard, and meets an hearty return of the Divine complacency;
for its spring, and motion, and life, is the very life of God in the soul,
and joins the soul to Him.
And "`he that is joined to the Lord, is one spirit,`" where He will not deny His own.
The rest is all chaff, and vanity, and tends directly to exalt the creature,
and its own activity, in opposition to the life and energy of God.
From the nature of the Deity, and His unwavering tendency towards union with us,
He must operate on us.
This, if submitted to, and rightly lived under by us, will result in true prayer,
and that prayer in substantial union.
And no possible substitution of words, and mere creaturely supplications, will ever,
in the least degree, promote this Divine union and fellowship;
but will forever retard it, and set up man, in separation from God, the Divine Life,
instead thereof.
